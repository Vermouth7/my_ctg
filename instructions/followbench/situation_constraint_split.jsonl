A constructor (__init__) that takes an account_number and an optional balance (default to 0).\n2. A deposit method that allows you to deposit a positive amount into the account. It should update the balance and return a message with the new balance.\n3. A withdraw method that allows you to withdraw a positive amount from the account, as long as the amount does not exceed the current balance. It should update the balance and return a message with the new balance.\n4. A get_balance method that returns the account's balance.\n\nCreate a SavingsAccount class that inherits from BankAccount. The SavingsAccount class should have an additional feature:\n1. A constructor (__init__) that takes an account_number, an optional balance (default to 0), and an optional interest_rate (default to 0.02).\n2. A method apply_interest that calculates and adds interest to the account balance based on the provided interest rate.\n\nImplement a Customer class that represents a bank customer. The Customer class should have the following features:\n1. A constructor (__init__) that takes the customer's name.\n2. A method add_account that allows you to add a BankAccount or SavingsAccount to the customer's list of accounts.\n3.
