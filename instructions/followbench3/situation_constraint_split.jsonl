[Implement the operator() method to allow access to individual elements with bounds checking and throw an std::out_of_range exception if indices are invalid. Also, implement the operator+ method for matrix addition, ensuring to throw an std::invalid_argument exception for dimension mismatches, and create a print method to display the matrix row by row.]", "level": 5}
