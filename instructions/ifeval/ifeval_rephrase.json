Make sure the summary contains less than 4 sentences.\n\nQuantum entanglement is the phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schrödinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox.

        "new_prompt": "What's different between \"the set of all sets that are not members of themselves\" and \"the set of all sets\"? Use mathematical notations in your answer. Be chatty while explaining. \n\nBooster: The first notable distinction arises when considering the paradox inherent in the \"set of all sets that are not members of themselves.\" In formal terms, let S = {x | x ∉ x}. If we examine whether S is a member of itself, we encounter a contradiction: if S ∈ S, then by definition S cannot contain itself; conversely, if S ∉ S, it must adhere to its own criteria, implying that it should indeed contain itself. This paradox highlights a fundamental limitation within naive set theory, leading to significant discussions in mathematical logic and set theory.\n\nFurthermore, contrasting this with \"the set of all sets,\" denoted as U, which ostensibly includes every conceivable set, leads to additional complications. Mathematically, if U contains all sets, it must also include S. However, this creates an overlap that challenges the foundational principles of set theory. Thus, the exploration of these two constructs reveals essential insights into the boundaries of set membership and the nature of self-reference in mathematical structures."
