The predicted velocity is 20% above the velocity measured by the photogate. Which of the following best describes the cause of the large percent difference?",
        "answer": 3,
        "choices": [
            "The ball changes its shape while falling.",
            "The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling.",
            "Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball.",
            "The acceleration of the balls varies with the velocity."

        "subject": "high_school_physics",
        "instruction 1": "Identify the assumptions made in the constant acceleration equations, particularly regarding the acceleration due to gravity and the negligible air resistance, and how these assumptions might impact the accuracy of the predicted velocity.",
        "instruction 2": "Consider the role of air resistance, which is not negligible for a tennis ball, and how this might lead to a significant difference between the predicted and measured velocities, especially at higher velocities."

        "question": "The Gravitron is a carnival ride that looks like a large cylinder. People stand inside the cylinder against the wall as it begins to spin. Eventually, it is rotating fast enough that the floor can be removed without anyone falling. Given then the coefficient of friction between a person’s clothing and the wall is μ, the tangential speed is v, and the radius of the ride is R, what is greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride?",

A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite’s velocity.
