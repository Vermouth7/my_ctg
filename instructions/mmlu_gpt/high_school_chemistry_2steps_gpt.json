        "instruction 1": "Analyze the shape of the graphs provided, noting that a straight line in the 1/[A] versus time graph indicates that the reaction follows second-order kinetics, while curved lines in the [A] versus time and ln [A] versus time graphs suggest that the reaction does not follow first-order or zero-order kinetics.",
        "instruction 2": "Confirm the implications of a second-order rate law, which involves the rate depending on the concentration of reactant A squared, and ensure the conclusion is based on the analysis of the graph shapes and their corresponding mathematical representations.",
        "question": "During the study of the reaction A → 2B, a chemist constructs several graphs. The graph of [A] versus time and the graph of ln [A] versus time both give a curved line; however, the graph of 1/[A] versus time and gives a straight line. This implies the rate law is",
