As an expert in problem analysis, your task is to identify the starting point of the error in the correct answer. I will provide you with the original problem, the correct answer, the incorrect answer, and the location where the error begins in the incorrect answer. You will need to locate the corresponding sentence in the correct answer where this error starts. Finally, output the identified part from correct answer the error starts, without any additional words or comments.

Here are two examples:

1. Question: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year?

Correct answer: He writes each friend 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 pages a week. So he writes 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 pages every week. That means he writes 12*52=<<12*52=624>>624 pages a year.\n#### 624

Wrong answer: Let's break this down step by step!\n\n1. James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\n2. This means he writes a total of 3 x 2 = 6 pages per week.\n3. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the number of pages he writes per week (6) by the number of weeks in a year (52):\n\n6 pages/week ร 52 weeks/year = 312 pages/year\n\n#### 312

Pivotal sentences: This means he writes a total of 3 x 2 = 6 pages per week.

Identified part: He writes each friend 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 pages a week. So he writes 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 pages every week.

2. Question: Randy has 60 mango trees on his farm. He also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?

Correct answer: Half of the number of Randy's mango trees is 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 trees.\nSo Randy has 30 - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25 coconut trees.\nTherefore, Randy has 60 + 25 = <<60+25=85>>85 trees on his farm.\n#### 85

Wrong answer: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Randy has 60 mango trees.\n2. He has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. To find the number of coconut trees, we need to find half of the number of mango trees and then subtract 5.\n\nHalf of 60 is:\n\n60 รท 2 = 30\n\nSo, Randy has 30 coconut trees.\n\n3. Now, let's add the number of mango trees and coconut trees to find the total number of trees:\n\n60 (mango trees) + 30 (coconut trees) = 90\n\n#### 90

Pivotal sentences: So, Randy has 30 coconut trees.

Identified part: Half of the number of Randy's mango trees is 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 trees.\nSo Randy has 30 - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25 coconut trees.
