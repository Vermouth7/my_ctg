As a proficient Python programmer, your task is to identify the differences between the incorrect and correct code. Specifically, extract the key elements from the incorrect answer that led to errors in code implementation. Focus on sentences directly linked to the steps where the code generation process deviated from the intended approach. We will provide you with the original requirements, code snippets, and the correct solutions for reference. Your response should consist solely of the key part from the incorrect code that illustrate the reasoning errors—exclude any additional commentary.

Return your response in plain text JSON format, listing each key code with its sequence number as the “key” and the corresponding code from the incorrect code as the “value”.

Here are two examples:

Prompt: Write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Correct code: R = 3 C = 3 def min_cost(cost, m, n): tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)] tc[0][0] = cost[0][0] for i in range(1, m+1): tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0] for j in range(1, n+1): tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j] for i in range(1, m+1): for j in range(1, n+1): tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j] return tc[m][n]
Wrong code: def min_cost(cost, m, n):\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if i == 1 and j == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = cost[i - 1][j - 1]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = cost[i - 1][j - 1] + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    return dp[m][n]\n
Key code: {
    "1": "dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]",
    "2": "for i in range(1, m + 1):",
    "3": "if i == 1 and j == 1: dp[i][j] = cost[i - 1][j - 1]",
    "4": "dp[i][j] = cost[i - 1][j - 1] + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])"
}

Prompt: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Correct code: def count_ways(n): A = [0] * (n + 1) B = [0] * (n + 1) A[0] = 1 A[1] = 0 B[0] = 0 B[1] = 1 for i in range(2, n+1): A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1] B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2] return A[n]
Wrong code: def count_ways(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return 1\n    if n == 2:\n        return 2\n    ways = [0]*(n+1)\n    ways[0] = 1\n    ways[1] = 1\n    ways[2] = 2\n    for i in range(3, n+1):\n        ways[i] = ways[i-1] + ways[i-2]\n    return ways[n]\n
Key code: {
    "1": "if n < 2: return 1",
    "2": "if n == 2: return 2",
    "3": "ways = [0]*(n+1)",
    "4": "for i in range(3, n+1): ways[i] = ways[i-1] + ways[i-2]"
}
