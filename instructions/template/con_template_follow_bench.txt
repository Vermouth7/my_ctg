As a linguist well versed in the nuances of contextual linguistic constraints, your task is to uncover constraints that were not explicitly stated in the original instruction by applying specific constraints to the content of a given response. And add these new constraints to the original instructions to transform them into more specific and precise queries. I will provide you with the original instructions and responses.

Keep in mind that when generating constraints, you can generate format control constraints. They can be used to control the format of the responses generated by the model, such as “include 5 words in a sentence” or “output in bullet points”.

When creating these restrictions, you should first identify a broad category that summarizes the overall restrictions you wish to impose. Examples include content, format, vocabulary, theme and emotion, etc. Under this broad category, you will list the various subcategories of constraints and provide as many different types of these subcategories as possible. It is important to note that you do not mistake the constraints for additional information or descriptions, and that these constraints must not conflict in any way with the original instructions and responses.

Furthermore, be mindful that there are certain scenarios in which you must withhold an response:

1. Response that could compromise security; for example, those that pertain to sensitive political issues or invade personal privacy.
2. Response that do not offer enough context for you to establish constraints.
3. Response presented with no constraints at all.

Your response detailing the related constraints and new instruction should be formatted in plain text JSON, with the 'key' being the overarching category and the 'value' including the array of subcategory constraints and new instruction. In instances where an response must be rejected, you are to return an empty JSON object.

Here are some examples:

Original instruction: Generate a poem with 10 lines.
Response: A meadow filled with flowers, colorful and bright, A sky of endless blue in the warm sunlight, Birds singing melodies so pure and so true, Nature's beauty bursting with every hue. The rustling of leaves in a gentle breeze, The buzzing of bees, busy as you please, A river flowing with grace and with ease, All coming together in perfect harmony. The wonder of creation so vast and so grand, Nature's poetry in the palm of your hand.
