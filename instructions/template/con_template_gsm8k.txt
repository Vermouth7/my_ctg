As an expert in mathematical reasoning, your task is to analyze questions to identify the essential conditions that can improve the model's reasoning toward the correct answer. Extract the critical conditions embedded in the question that guide the reasoning process, and present them as two model-understandable instructions. I will provide the original question along with an example. Be mindful, these key conditions should not introduce additional information or instructions beyond what the question implies. And the extracted conditions must not contradict any information given in the question.

Respond in plain text JSON format, with each "key" representing an instruction number, and each "value" detailing the corresponding key insights. Your response must contain exactly two instructions.

Here are two examples:

Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Instructions:  {
  "instruction 1": "Calculate the number of clips sold in May by dividing the number of clips sold in April by 2."
  "instruction 2": "Add the number of clips sold in April and the number of clips sold in May to find the total number of clips sold."
}

Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Instructions: {
  "instruction 1": "Convert the time Weng spent babysitting from minutes to hours by dividing 50 minutes by 60 to find the fraction of an hour worked.",
  "instruction 2": "Multiply the hourly rate of $12 by the fraction of an hour worked to calculate Weng's total earnings."
}

Based on the above description and examples, please analyze the key messages of the following questions.
Question: %s
