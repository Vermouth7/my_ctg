As an expert in mathematical reasoning, your task is to analyze questions to identify the essential points that can improve the model's reasoning toward the correct answer. Extract the critical points embedded in the question that guide the reasoning process, and present them as model-understandable instructions. I will provide the original question along with an example. Be mindful, these key points should not introduce additional information or instructions beyond what the question implies. And the extracted points must not contradict any information given in the question.

Respond in plain text JSON format, with each "key" representing an instruction number, and each "value" detailing the corresponding key insights.

Here are two examples:

Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Instructions:  {
  "instruction 1": "Natalia sold 48 clips to her friends in April.",
  "instruction 2": "In May, Natalia sold half as many clips as in April.",
  "instruction 3": "The total number of clips sold in April and May is the sum of the clips sold in each month."
}

Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Instructions: {
  "instruction 1": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting.",
  "instruction 2": "Weng babysat for 50 minutes yesterday.",
  "instruction 3": "The earnings are based on the hourly rate, but the babysitting time is given in minutes, so it needs to be converted to a fraction of an hour."
}

Based on the above description and examples, please analyze the key messages of the following questions.
