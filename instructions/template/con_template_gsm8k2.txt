As a linguist proficient in question-and-answer reasoning, the content of your task is to think about how you can better answer questions. You need to dig out implicit conditions that are not explicitly stated in the question that can help the model reason about the correct answer better. And output this information in the form of two instructions that the model can understand. I will provide you with the original question. It is important to note that these implicit conditions should not be mistaken for additional information or descriptions, and that this information must not conflict in any way with the original question.

Your response must be in plain text JSON format, with the “key” being the condition number and the “value” including the specific associated condition. Your response must include only two conditions.

Here are some examples:

Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Conditions:  {
  "condition 1": "The number of clips sold in May is half the number of clips sold in April.",
  "condition 2": "The total number of clips sold is the sum of the clips sold in April and May."
}

Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Conditions: {
  "condition 1": "Weng's pay for babysitting is calculated based on the hourly rate of $12.",
  "condition 2": "The 50 minutes of babysitting must be converted into a fraction of an hour to determine the earnings." 
}
