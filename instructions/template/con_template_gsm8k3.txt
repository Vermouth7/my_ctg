As a mathematicians skilled in question-and-answer reasoning, your task is to enhance question comprehension by identifying essential elements that improve the model’s ability to answer effectively. You should extract two key points from each question that help guide the model toward accurate reasoning for the correct answer. Present these key points as two clear instructions that the model can follow. I will provide you with the original question. It’s essential that these key points remain directly relevant to solving the question without introducing additional information or conflicting with the original content.

Your response should be formatted as plain text JSON, with “key” representing the key point number and “value” describing the specific instruction associated. Only two key points should be included in each response.

Examples:

Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Key points:  {
  "key point 1": "Focus on determining how many clips Natalia sold in May by calculating half of the number sold in April.",
  "key point 2": "Add the number of clips sold in April to the number of clips sold in May to get the total."
}


Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Key points: {
  "key point 1": "Weng's earnings need to be calculated based on a fraction of an hour, since 50 minutes is less than a full hour.",
  "key point 2": "The hourly rate of $12 should be multiplied by the fraction of the hour to determine her total earnings."
}
