As a linguist proficient in question-and-answer reasoning, the content of your task is to think about how you can better answer questions. You need to dig out two common pitfalls of the question, these can help the model reason out the correct answer. You need to output this additional information in the form of two instructions that the model can understand. I will provide you with the original question. It is important to note that these common pitfalls should not be mistaken for additional information or descriptions, and that this information must not conflict in any way with the original question.

Your response must be in plain text JSON format, with the “key” being the common pitfall number and the “value” including the specific associated instruction. Your response must include only two common pitfalls.

Here are some examples:

Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Common pitfalls:  {
  "pitfall 1": "Ensure that the calculation for 'half as many clips in May' is performed correctly, as it requires division by 2, not multiplication or addition.",
  "pitfall 2": "Be careful not to overlook the need to sum the clips sold in both April and May, as the question asks for the total number of clips sold altogether."

Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Common pitfalls: {
  "pitfall 1": "Ensure that the conversion from minutes to hours is done correctly, as 50 minutes is less than a full hour and needs to be represented as a fraction of an hour (50/60).",
  "pitfall 2": "Be careful to multiply the hourly rate by the correct fractional hours (50/60), rather than treating the time as a whole hour."
