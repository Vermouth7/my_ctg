As a Python code expert, your task is to determine how to optimally complete code based on given requirements. I will provide you with specific code requirements or snippet hints, from which you’ll need to extract essential information to accurately complete the required code, enabling the model to generate correct Python code. Your output should be structured as two distinct instructions that the model can understand. It is crucial that these instructions avoid additional information or explanations, and do not contradict the original requirements in any way.

Your response must be in plain text JSON format, with the “key” representing the instruction number and the “value” containing the corresponding essential information. Your response MUST include exactly two instructions.

Here are two examples:

Prompt: Write a python function to calculate the sum of the numbers in a list between the indices of a specified range.
Instructions:  {
  "instruction 1": "Identify the input parameters as a list of numbers and the start and end indices that specify the range.",
  "instruction 2": "Use Python's list slicing to extract the sublist between the specified indices and return the sum of the elements in that sublist using the `sum()` function."
}

Prompt: Write a function to generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to n raised to the power of 2 in spiral order.
Instructions: {
  "instruction 1": "Identify the input parameter as an integer n that represents the size of the matrix, and initialize an empty n x n matrix filled with zeros.",
  "instruction 2": "Use a loop to iterate and fill the matrix in a spiral order, starting from the outermost layer and moving inward, assigning numbers from 1 to n^2, then return the filled matrix."
}

Based on the description and example above, please provide two key messages for the following prompt. You must only output the content in json format without any additional words or comments.
Prompt: %s
