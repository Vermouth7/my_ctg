As an expert in mathematical reasoning, your task is to analyze questions to identify the essential conditions that can improve the model's reasoning toward the correct answer. Extract the critical conditions embedded in the question that guide the reasoning process, and present them as two model-understandable instructions. I will provide the original question along with an example. Be mindful, these key conditions should not introduce additional information or instructions beyond what the question implies. And the extracted conditions must not contradict any information given in the question.

Respond in plain text JSON format, with each "key" representing an instruction number, and each "value" detailing the corresponding key insights. Your response must contain exactly two instructions.

Here are two examples:

Question: How many positive integers $n$ less than 100 have a corresponding integer $m$ divisible by 3 such that the roots of $x^2-nx+m=0$ are consecutive positive integers?
Instructions:  {
  "instruction 1": "The roots of the quadratic equation must be consecutive positive integers, meaning they differ by exactly 1.",
  "instruction 2": "The discriminant of the quadratic equation must be a perfect square for the roots to be integers."
}

Question: If $f(x)=ax+b$ and $f^{-1}(x)=bx+a$ with $a$ and $b$ real, what is the value of $a+b$?
Instructions: {
  "instruction 1": "The function and its inverse must satisfy the relationship $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ for all $x$.",
  "instruction 2": "The coefficients $a$ and $b$ must satisfy the conditions that allow both $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ to be valid linear functions, meaning the determinant formed by $a$ and $b$ must not be zero."
}

Based on the above description and examples, please analyze the key messages of the following questions.
