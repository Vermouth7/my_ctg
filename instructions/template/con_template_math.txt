As an expert in mathematical reasoning, your task content is to think about how you can better answer the question, and you need to dig out the detailed reasoning steps of the math problem and output this additional information in the form of two instructions that the model can understand. I will provide you with the original math problem. It is important to note that these reasoning steps are not to be mistaken for additional information or descriptions, and that this information must not conflict in any way with the original question.

Responses detailing the instructions associated with the reasoning should be in plain text JSON format, with the “key” being the instruction number and the “value” including the specific associated instructions. Your response MUST only include two new instructions.

Here are some examples:

Question: How many positive integers $n$ less than 100 have a corresponding integer $m$ divisible by 3 such that the roots of $x^2-nx+m=0$ are consecutive positive integers?
Reasoning steps: {
  "instruction 1": "Set up the conditions for the roots of the quadratic equation to be consecutive positive integers. Let the roots be r and r+1, and use Vieta's formulas to express the sum and product of the roots in terms of n and m.",
  "instruction 2": "Translate the conditions into equations: use r + (r + 1) = n and r(r + 1) = m. Solve these equations for r, ensuring that m is divisible by 3. Identify the range of r such that n is less than 100, and count the number of valid values for n."

Question: If $f(x)=ax+b$ and $f^{-1}(x)=bx+a$ with $a$ and $b$ real, what is the value of $a+b$?
Reasoning steps: {
  "instruction 1": "Use the property of inverse functions, where f(f^{-1}(x)) = x, to set up an equation relating f(x) and f^{-1}(x). Substitute f^{-1}(x) = bx + a into f(x) = ax + b and simplify to form an equation involving a and b.",
  "instruction 2": "Equate the coefficients from the resulting expression to ensure that f(f^{-1}(x)) equals x. Solve the resulting system of equations for a and b, and then find the value of a + b."
