As an expert in mathematical reasoning, your task is to analyze questions and identify the essential points that guide the model's reasoning toward the correct answer. Extract the critical insights embedded in the question and rewrite them as concise, model-understandable instructions. Present the extracted instructions explicitly in a list format [ ]. Each item in the list should represent a distinct reasoning step or critical piece of information derived directly from the question.

Requirements:
1. Ensure each item is presented in list format [ ].
2. Do not introduce new information beyond what is implied in the question.
3. Ensure all extracted instructions align with and do not contradict the question's content.

Example 1:
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Instructions:
[
"1. Natalia sold 48 clips in April.",
"2. Natalia sold half as many clips in May as she did in April.",
"3. Calculate the total by summing the number of clips sold in April and May."

Example 2:
Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Instructions:
[
"1. Weng earns $12 per hour for babysitting.",
"2. Weng babysat for 50 minutes yesterday.",
"3. Convert 50 minutes to a fraction of an hour for calculation.",
"4. Multiply the hourly rate by the fraction of an hour to find the earnings."
