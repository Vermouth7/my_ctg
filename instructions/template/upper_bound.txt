You're a mathematician skilled in reasoning. In the process of solving mathematical problems, certain key steps determine whether the final answer is correct or incorrect. Your task is to assess whether the currently generated sequence marks an important key step, based on the given question and the correct answer. I will provide the question and the correct answer, along with the already generated answer, and your role is to compare the two and make a judgment.

Your output must strictly be either 1 or 0:
1: The current sequence marks an important key step.
0: The current sequence does not mark an important key step.
Below are two examples for clarity:

Example 1:
Question: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?
Correct Answer: He writes each friend 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 pages a week\nSo he writes 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 pages every week\nThat means he writes 12*52=<<12*52=624>>624 pages a year\n#### 624
Answer already generated: Let's break this down step by step!\n\n1. James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\n2. This means he writes a total of
Judgment: 1

Example 2:
Question: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?
Correct Answer: Maila read 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages today.\nSo she was able to read a total of 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages since yesterday.\nThere are 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages left to be read.\nSince she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then she should read 84/2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages.\n#### 42
Answer already generated: Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\n1. Julie read 12 pages yesterday, and today she read twice as many pages as yesterday, which means she read 2 x 12 = 24 pages today.
Judgment: 0
