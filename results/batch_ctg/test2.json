They are more likely to be denied equal access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. And yet, despite these glaring disparities, we continue to turn a blind eye, pretending"

They are formed when water vapor in the air condenses into visible liquid droplets or ice crystals. This process occurs when the air cools to its dew point, which is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated with water vapor and can no longer hold any more moisture. Clouds can be classified into several types, including cirrus, cumulus, stratus, and nimbus. Each type of cloud has its own unique characteristics, such as shape, size, and altitude.\n\nClouds play a crucial role in the Earth"
