So, the correct answer is: Kids were playing too loud outside to concentrate.\n\n5. Kelly's story:\nThe description says Kelly had a fun soccer match with her friends and won. This implies that Kelly's hard work paid off. So, the correct answer is: Kelly played really hard.\n\n6. Samantha's story:\nThe description says Samantha wanted a new TV and ended up with crippling debt for years. This implies that Samantha took out a loan to buy the TV. So, the correct answer is: Samantha took out a loan for a TV."}

You're correct that Ally was awakened by a noise at night and was afraid is more believable, as it fits with the fact that Ally is afraid of ghosts, which is often associated with the nighttime.\n\n2.

Deciding to never practice again wouldn't improve his skills and would likely lead to further losses.\n\n3. It's more believable that Ray found the coin machine and went to work, as it's a common and logical explanation for why the teller would hand Ray $50 in cash. The alternative explanation, that the teller told Ray they didn't accept loose change, wouldn't result in Ray receiving cash.\n\n4.

{"prompt_new": "Context: On 21 September, 2015, Canadians Robert Hall and John Ridsdel, as well as Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad, and  Marites Flor; a Filipino woman, were abducted on Samai island near Davao. Ridsdel was beheaded by Abu Sayyaf on 25 April 2016 following a ransom deadline. ASG reportedly demanded more than $8.1 million for Ridsdel and the others. On 3 May, 2016, a video of the Ridsdel execution was released, along with new demands for the remaining hostages. A masked captor said, \"Note to the Philippine government and to the Canadian government: The lesson is clear. John Ridsdel has been beheaded. Now there are three remaining captives here. If you procrastinate once again the negotiations, we will behead this all anytime\". On 15 May, Hall  appeared in a new video, announcing that he and Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad would be decapitated at 3pm on Monday 13 June absent a ransom of $16 million. Both hostages wore orange coveralls, similar to hostages in videos produced by ISIL, to which Abu Sayyaf had previously pledged allegiance. The deadline passed. Hall was beheaded. On 24 June, Abu Sayyaf released Filipina Marites Flor. She was subsequently flown to Davao to meet President-elect Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte said he directed negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf. He did not elaborate. On 17 September, 2016, remaining hostage Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island. Abu Ramie, an ASG spokesman, claimed $638,000 was paid as ransom.\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1 per cent , seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians. While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56. At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or K\u014dain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. In Java, between 4 and 10 million r\u014dmusha , were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.

After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead.

He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included \"not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents.\" Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000. The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback\u2014who were few in numbers\u2014were armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour.

About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\nThe response of the bot is: 80556\n\nContext:  The Patriots were hoping to stave off a losing streak and rebound from their loss to the Cardinals in this rematch of the AFC Championship. After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead. Following a Ravens punt the Patriots drove all the way to the Ravens 2-yard line, but had to settle for a 20-yard field goal, making the score 30-21 early in the fourth quarter. The Ravens proceeded to drive...\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.  Can you tell me the answer?\nQuestion: How many points did the Ravens win by?\nAnswer:\nAI assistant: 1\n\nQuestion: Who did Vlad \u0162epe\u015f want mobilized?\nAnswer based on following passage.\n\nVlad \u0162epe\u015f asked the Hungarian king for assistance.  He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included \"not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents.\" Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000. The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback\u2014who were few in numbers\u2014were armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour. Vlad's personal guard consisted of mercenaries from many countries and some Gypsies. Before battle, it is believed that Vlad told his men that \"it would be better that those who think of death should not follow me\".\n\nAnswer:\nBot: men of military age, women and of children, Gypsy slave contingents\n\nContext: Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Packers, the Vikings played their Week 2 home opener against the Indianapolis Colts. In the first half, kicker Ryan Longwell helped Minnesota take the early lead with a 45-yard and a 27-yard field goal in the first quarter, along with a 53-yard field goal in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the Vikes increased its lead with Longwell getting a 46-yard and a 28-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with RB Joseph Addai getting a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Indianapolis continued to gain ground as QB Peyton Manning completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, followed by a two-point conversion run by RB Dominic Rhodes. Later, the Colts sealed the win with kicker Adam Vinatieri nailing the game-winning 47-yard field goal.\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.  Can you tell me the answer?\nQuestion: How many field goals did Ryan Longwell kick?\nAnswer:", "result": "Based on the passage, the answer to your question is:\n\nWhat happened first, a video of the Ridsdel execution being released or the release of Kjartan Sekkingstad?\n\nAnswer: A video of the Ridsdel execution was released first, on 3 May 2016."}

{"prompt_new": "Tell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: More Than 22% of Heart-Device Implantations Aren\u2019t In Line With Guidelines\n\nPassage: The story deserves high marks for bringing costs into the discussion right in the lead. \u201cIn more than 22% of cases, implantable defibrillators are given to heart patients who don\u2019t meet the guidelines for receiving the pricey devices, according to a study just published in JAMA.\u201d The story also says, \u201cICDs, which can cost north of $30,000, monitor the rhythm of the heart and produce a shock to bring irregular beating back to normal.\u201d But just as with the Times story, the cost of the device and hospitalizations is only a piece of the economic picture. Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits. This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied? And what is the bill that the 22.5% will not fit? The LA Times story examines the study in much clearer language and provides the right context. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. We spent some time on the fence...\nThe response of the bot is: likely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Pill Treats Painful Fibroids\n\nPassage: The story does not describe costs of the drug. The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids. Likewise, the Mirena IUD often stops bleeding altogether. NSAIDs can...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Heart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\n\nPassage: There is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story. The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug. (By digging into the research paper, via figure 3, we found that the benefits were measured by tracking absolute increases in\u00a0ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood pumped out the ventricles. It increased 8% in the group receiving a medium or high dose of the medicine.) One issue that might be confusing for readers: The story notes that a \u201cphase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why is the framing of the story about how effective it was? The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up. This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug\u2019s development. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said. But, as noted in quantify benefits criterion above, readers...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely true\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: New Tools for Helping Heart Patients\n\nPassage: \"Mixed bag. The story explained that the devices \"\"can cost as much as $30,000.\"\" And there was one data point from one study on one device that users\u2019 hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission. But the device costs are variable and device performance will be variable. We\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt but it painted the cost picture with really broad strokes. Information about the potential to increase longevity was presented from a study that has not yet been published. The information was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute increase. The story didn\u2019t contain sufficient information to quantify the benefit to any specific group of patients. The story did mention the problem of potential information overload however there was no discussion of actual harm such as inappropriate shocks from implanted defibrillator devices, for example. There was no questioning of the accuracy of the data potentially transmitted by devices. This was a far too rosy picture \u2013 almost as if all the data was so terrific that the only downside could be the volume of terrific data. Other things can go wrong as past experience shows when you try to regulate the heart. In our eyes, a red flag went up when the story cited \"\"a paper under review.\"\" We don\u2019t know the quality of the paper nor have peer reviewers completed their review yet. So that\u2019s giving the researcher free rein to say whatever he wants about that study. We also must address the headline which stated \u2018New tools for helping heart patients\u2019 before we have concrete demonstration that the new tools actually do help. The story opened with an anecdote that implied that something terrible was avoided. That, of course, is always hard to know. The punch line is that without the device reporting in to a clinician, the situation was one in which it \u00a0\"\"could have gone for months before the problem was discovered.\"\" The story never considered the question of whether there is always value in immediate recognition of a situation. Clinicians who were...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Seven presidents before (Barack Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans.\n\nPassage: \"President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law has been one of the most polarizing aspects of his presidency, with Republicans criticizing it at every turn. But the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, didn\u2019t run from it. He applauded Obama for pursuing expanded health care -- and succeeding where his predecessors had failed. \"\"Seven presidents before him -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans,\"\" Castro said. \"\"President Obama got it done.\"\" We wondered whether Castro\u2019s history was correct. So we checked with a variety of public policy and health care historians and found that Castro\u2019s in the ballpark -- but that a lot of caveats are in order. Let\u2019s start with the presidents who almost certainly fit Castro\u2019s definition of having \"\"tried to expand health care to all Americans.\"\" \u2022 Harry Truman. On Nov. 19, 1945, Truman wrote a message to Congress saying that \"\"the health of American children, like their education, should be recognized as a definite public responsibility.\"\" According to the Truman Library, \"\"the most controversial aspect of the plan was the proposed national health insurance plan.\"\" It called for \"\"the creation of a national health insurance fund to be run by the federal government. This fund would be open to all Americans, but would remain optional. Participants would pay monthly fees into the plan, which would cover the cost of any and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need. The government would pay for the cost of services rendered by any doctor who chose to join the program.\"\" The American Medical Association attacked the plan, characterizing the bill as \"\"socialized medicine.\"\" Truman ultimately abandoned the effort after the outbreak of the Korean War \u2022 Richard Nixon. In 1971 and 1974, Nixon offered separate proposals to expand health insurance to all, or nearly all, Americans.

It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works.

Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided.

The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied?

For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids.

Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session.

Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids. Likewise, the Mirena IUD often stops bleeding altogether. NSAIDs can...\n\nbecause of:\n#Answer#\nFibroids are common and can cause bothersome symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and pressure in some women. However, they are also benign and deciding about how or whether to treatment them depends on how much a woman is bothered by her symptoms, feels about the pros and cons of different treatments, and whether she wishes to conserve her fertility. There are many different safe and viable treatments available, ranging from medications to minimally invasive procedures to surgery. Women who make a fully-informed decision about treatment in conjunction with their doctor are likely to be satisfied with their treatment so long as their choice matches their goals and what\u2019s important to them. Even with so many options, it would be welcome news that a drug may not just treat the symptoms but actually might reduce the size of fibroids. A new study presented at this week\u2019s European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology shows that EllaOne, currently available as an emergency contraceptive in Europe (but not in the US), may shrink fibroids and reduce symptoms relative to placebo. However, the results should be greeted cautiously. This was a small, short study and the full results have not been evaluated. More research is needed to confirm them and answer many outstanding questions. Whilet EllaOne may be shown to\u00a0 be very helpful to women with fibroids in the future, these results are\u00a0premature at best.\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Heart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\n\nPassage: There is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story. The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug. (By digging into the research paper, via figure 3, we found that the benefits were measured by tracking absolute increases in\u00a0ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood pumped out the ventricles. It increased 8% in the group receiving a medium or high dose of the medicine.) One issue that might be confusing for readers: The story notes that a \u201cphase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why is the framing of the story about how effective it was? The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up. This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug\u2019s development. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said. But, as noted in quantify benefits criterion above, readers...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely true\n\nI  could not conclude:\n\nNew Tools for Helping Heart Patients\n\nfrom:\n\n\"Mixed bag. The story explained that the devices \"\"can cost as much as $30,000.\"\" And there was one data point from one study on one device that users\u2019 hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission. But the device costs are variable and device performance will be variable. We\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt but it painted the cost picture with really broad strokes. Information about the potential to increase longevity was presented from a study that has not yet been published. The information was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute increase. The story didn\u2019t contain sufficient information to quantify the benefit to any specific group of patients. The story did mention the problem of potential information overload however there was no discussion of actual harm such as inappropriate shocks from implanted defibrillator devices, for example. There was no questioning of the accuracy of the data potentially transmitted by devices. This was a far too rosy picture \u2013 almost as if all the data was so terrific that the only downside could be the volume of terrific data. Other things can go wrong as past experience shows when you try to regulate the heart. In our eyes, a red flag went up when the story cited \"\"a paper under review.\"\" We don\u2019t know the quality of the paper nor have peer reviewers completed their review yet. So that\u2019s giving the researcher free rein to say whatever he wants about that study. We also must address the headline which stated \u2018New tools for helping heart patients\u2019 before we have concrete demonstration that the new tools actually do help. The story opened with an anecdote that implied that something terrible was avoided. That, of course, is always hard to know. The punch line is that without the device reporting in to a clinician, the situation was one in which it \u00a0\"\"could have gone for months before the problem was discovered.\"\" The story never considered the question of whether there is always value in immediate recognition of a situation.

It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works. We don\u2019t know how many participants were in each trial and who actually benefited from massage therapy. The release alludes to the fact several times that the immune system became stronger, but how was this measured? There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold. The second study (from 2001)...", "result": "Based on the passage, I would rate the claim \"Massage Therapy May Boost Immune System to Combat Cold, Flu\" as likely false.\n\nThe passage raises several concerns about the quality of the evidence presented, including:\n\n* Lack of specific data on the benefits of massage therapy\n* Vague descriptions of the research\n* No information on the number of participants or who benefited from the treatment\n* No clear measurement of how the immune system became stronger\n* The studies cited do not relate to massage therapy for reducing rates of the common cold, flu, and other seasonal illnesses\n\nOverall, the passage suggests that the claim is likely exaggerated or misleading, and that more rigorous research is needed to support the idea that massage therapy can boost the immune system to combat cold and flu."}
{"prompt_new": "After reading:\n\n The story deserves high marks for bringing costs into the discussion right in the lead. \u201cIn more than 22% of cases, implantable defibrillators are given to heart patients who don\u2019t meet the guidelines for receiving the pricey devices, according to a study just published in JAMA.\u201d The story also says, \u201cICDs, which can cost north of $30,000, monitor the rhythm of the heart and produce a shock to bring irregular beating back to normal.\u201d But just as with the Times story, the cost of the device and hospitalizations is only a piece of the economic picture. Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits. This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied? And what is the bill that the 22.5% will not fit? The LA Times story examines the study in much clearer language and provides the right context. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. We spent some time on the fence...\n\nI  do not think it is completely true that:\n\nMore Than 22% of Heart-Device Implantations Aren\u2019t In Line With Guidelines\n\nis true because of:\n{'AI assistant': 'This blog post about a study revealing some new data about the overuse of heart implants does some things quite well, but it falls short on a number of our measures. See the Los Angeles Times piece which we also reviewed for comparison. While The WSJ blog includes cost information, which is too often missed in stories, it does not provide enough hard data on the risks or benefits of heart implants. It also should have done a better job evaluating the evidence in this study but, instead, left reviewers \u2013 and, we bet, readers \u2013 confused. When a study this large finds that 1 out of every 5 people may have unnecessarily undergone a surgery that led to longer hospital stays in, in a minority, a shorter life, that\u2019s big news. Reporters need to make sure that they give readers the proper context to process findings this dramatic. Identifying the best candidates for ICD pacement is not an exact science. Guidelines have been developed to help clinicians and patients determine the best course of action. The guidelines are, at best, interpretations of existing information generated in clinical trials. While useful, they are by no means exact. The study in question examined data collected from a national registry on over 100,000 patients and concluded that 1/5th of the implants were outside existing guidelines. While the findings in the study are\u00a0troubling at face value, the story appears to be a bit more complicated. The accompanying editorial places the results in a slightly different perspective. Of the four criteria examined, only one (placement of the ICD in patients with severe heart failure) is an absolute. The other three criteria are related purely to timing and not to whether the device is of value. Heart failure patients need the tools to help them ask their doctors the right questions. This story did not provide them enough of those tools.'}\n\nAfter reading:\n\n The story does not describe costs of the drug.

The story would have been stronger if it had detailed exactly what the researchers were measuring when they concluded the drug worked better than placebo. Obviously, if a new drug is found that works effectively to thwart this kind of heart disease, then that\u2019s good news all around, especially if the drug is needed less frequently and is well tolerated, as the story suggests. But care needs to be taken in potentially over-touting the results of these very early trials, and therefore raising the hopes of patients who may be disappointed at a later stage in the research process.

The lead actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman, she looks, acts and talks very much like a 'high-standing' woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor. The photography is ugly, not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times. The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The film-maker was by the door.

I've never told anyone about what happened at the fork in the stream that day, and I never will. I've decided to write it down, though, in this book, which I will leave on the table beside my bed. I can't write long, because my hands shake so these days and I have next to no strength, but I don't think it will take long. Later, someone may find what I have written. That seems likely to me, as it is pretty much human nature to look in a book marked \"Diary\" after its owner has passed along. So, yes -- my works will probably be read. A better question is whether anyone will believe them. Almost certainly not, but that doesn't matter. It's not belief I'm interested in but freedom. Writing can give that, I've found.\n\n2.

This is done by using the modulo operator (%):\n\n1078 % 23 = 11\n\nSince 11 is not zero, we need to add a number to 1078 to make it divisible by 23. The least such number is 12 - 11 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (a) 3.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nWhat will be the compound interest on a sum of Rs. 24,000 after 3 years at the rate of 12% p.a.?\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(n\\*t)\n\nWhere:\nA = final amount\nP = principal amount (Rs. 24,000)\nr = rate of interest (12% = 0.12)\nn = number of times interest is compounded per year (1 for annual compounding)\nt = time in years (3 years)\n\nA = 24,000(1 + 0.12/1)^(1*3) = 24,000(1.036)^3 = 24,018.27\n\nThe compound interest is the difference between the final amount and the principal:\n\nCompound interest = 24,018.27 - 24,000 = Rs. 18.27\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the correct answer is (a) Rs. 9718.27.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nThe sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550. What is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive?\n\nTo solve this problem, we can find the sum of the first 50 positive even integers and then subtract the sum of the first 101 even integers (since 302 is the 101st even integer) to get the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400:\n\nSum of first 50 even integers = 2550\nSum of first 101 even integers = 2550 + 101 + 102 + ... + 400\n\nWe can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = n(a1 + an) / 2\n\nWhere:\nn = number of terms (101)\na1 = first term (2)\nan = last term (400)\n\nSum = 101(2 + 400) / 2 = 101(402) / 2 = 20,550\n\nThe correct answer is (c) 17,550.\n\n**Problem 4:**\nThere are 8 teams in a certain league, and each team faces another team for a total of 12 times. How many games are played in the season?\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the formula for the number of combinations:\n\nnCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nWhere:\nn = total number of teams (8)\nr = number of teams facing each other (2)\n\nNumber of games = 8C2 = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 28\n\nHowever, each game is played twice (once for each team), so we need to divide the result by 2:\n\nNumber of games = 28 / 2 = 14\n\nThe correct answer is (c) 144.\n\n**Problem 5:**\nThe maximum number of students among them 1020 pens and 860 pencils can be distributed in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens and same number of pencils is:\n\nLet's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1020 and 860:\n\n1020 = 2^2 \\* 3 \\* 5 \\* 34\n860 = 2^2 \\* 5 \\* 43\n\nGCD = 2^2 \\* 5 = 20\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students is 20.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) 20.\n\n**Problem 6:**\nA dress on sale in a shop is marked at $d.

In this case, n = 50, and Sn = 50*51 = 2550.\n\nThe sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive can be found by finding the sum of the first 50 positive even integers (2550) and adding the sum of the even integers from 502 to 400 inclusive.\n\nThe sum of the even integers from 502 to 400 inclusive is given by the formula Sn = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, n = 50, a = 502, and d = 2. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nSn = (50/2)(2*502 + (50-1)*2) = 25*(1004 + 98) = 25*1102 = 27550\n\nThe sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive is 2550 + 27550 = 30100.\n\nThe correct answer is not among the options.\n\n4. There are, in a certain league, 8 teams, and each team faces another team for a total of 12 times.

To solve this problem, you can calculate the discount on the marked price:\n\nDiscount = 0.25d\n\nThe discounted price is:\n\nd - 0.25d = 0.75d\n\nThe staff member gets a further 20% reduction on the discounted price:\n\n0.8 * 0.75d = 0.6d\n\nSo, the staff member has to pay 0.6d."}

To solve the problem \"what least number must be added to 1078, so that the sum is completely divisible by 23?\", I would calculate the remainder when 1078 is divided by 23. The remainder is 11. Therefore, the least number that must be added to 1078 to make it divisible by 23 is 23 - 11 = 12.\n\nSo, the correct answer is not among the options. However, I can suggest that the correct answer is 12.\n\n2. The category for the problem \"what will be the compound interest on a sum of rs . 24,000 after 3 years at the rate of 12 % p . a . ?\" is \"gain\".\n\n3. To solve the problem \"the sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550 . what is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive ?\", I would calculate the sum of the first 50 positive even integers as follows:\n\n2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 100 = 2550\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with a first term of 2, a last term of 100, and a common difference of 2. The sum of the series can be calculated as:\n\nSum = n/2 (2a + (n-1)d)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. In this case, n = 50, a = 2, and d = 2. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nSum = 50/2 (2(2) + (50-1)2) = 50/2 (4 + 98) = 25 (102) = 2550\n\nNow, to find the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive, I would calculate the average of the first and last terms, multiply it by the number of terms, and then multiply the result by 2:\n\nAverage = (302 + 400)/2 = 351\n\nNumber of terms = 400 - 302 + 1 = 99\n\nSum = 99 x 351 x 2 = 17,550\n\nSo, the correct answer is d) 17,550.\n\n4. To solve the problem \"there are , in a certain league , 8 teams , and each team face another team for a total of 12 times . how many games are played in the season ?\", I would calculate the number of games played by each team as follows:\n\nEach team plays 12 games against other teams, and there are 8 teams. To find the total number of games played, I would multiply the number of games played by each team by the number of teams, and then divide the result by 2 to avoid double-counting:\n\nTotal games = 12 x 8 x 1/2 = 96\n\nSo, the correct answer is c) 96.\n\n5. To solve the problem \"the maximum number of student amoung them 1020 pens and 860 pencils can be distributed in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens and same number of pencils is :\", I would calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1020 and 860 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1020 = 860 x 1 + 160\n860 = 160 x 5 + 60\n160 = 60 x 2 + 40\n60 = 40 x 1 + 20\n40 = 20 x 2\n\nThe GCD is 20. Therefore, the maximum number of students that can receive the same number of pens and pencils is 20.\n\nSo, the correct answer is a) 20.\n\n6. To solve the problem \"a dress on sale in a shop is marked at $ d . during the discount sale its price is reduced by 25 % . staff are allowed a further 20 % reduction on the discounted price . if a staff member buys the dress what will she have to pay in terms of d ?\", I would calculate the discounted price after the first discount:\n\nDiscounted price = d - 25% of d = d - 0.25d = 0.75d\n\nThen, I would calculate the discounted price after the second discount:\n\nStaff discount = 20% of 0.75d = 0.2 x 0.75d = 0.15d\n\nThe final price paid by the staff member is:\n\nFinal price = 0.75d - 0.15d = 0.6d\n\nSo, the correct answer is a) 0.6d."}

His strict uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) has no patience for his disrespect for the monarchy, chastising him and telling him he must marry a rich American, as the Mountbatten family finances are depleted. After his uncle told him that on his \"thirtieth birthday he had become a blemish to the family name\", Leopold counters that the new nobility is to be found in those who pursue initiatives, hence his interest in the sciences.\nOne day, the Duke finds Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), an amateur physicist (and descendant of Leopold) in his study perusing his schematic diagrams and taking photographs of them. He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus.

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house.

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl.

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette\u00a0\u2013 the dummy created by 9...\n\nQuestion: What does 5's soul do before returning to his rag doll skin?\nBot: It turns to 9 and nods in approval\n\n<html>\n<head><title>High Fidelity Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"High Fidelity script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"High Fidelity script, High Fidelity movie script, High Fidelity film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump...\n\nQuestion: What does the boy who is interviewing Louis want?", "result": "According to the synopsis, the boy who is interviewing Louis wants to know Louis' story."}

In attempt to avoid an altercation, the people of Linnville respond as politely as possible and continue on with the picnic as though nothing happened.\nMrs. Jameson proceeds to insult the women of the village at their next meeting - the Ladies' Sewing Circle.

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump...\n\nQuestion: What does the boy who is interviewing Louis want?", "result": "I'd be happy to help!\n\nAccording to the synopsis, the residents of Linnville pride themselves on the lack of tourism and absence of a summer hotel."}

His strict uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) has no patience for his disrespect for the monarchy, chastising him and telling him he must marry a rich American, as the Mountbatten family finances are depleted. After his uncle told him that on his \"thirtieth birthday he had become a blemish to the family name\", Leopold counters that the new nobility is to be found in those who pursue initiatives, hence his interest in the sciences.\nOne day, the Duke finds Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), an amateur physicist (and descendant of Leopold) in his study perusing his schematic diagrams and taking photographs of them. He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus. He observes that she is a \"career woman\" and that her field, market research, is a fine avocation for a woman and states that he once dated a librarian from Sussex.

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette\u00a0\u2013 the dummy created by 9...\n\n<html>\n<head><title>High Fidelity Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"High Fidelity script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"High Fidelity script, High Fidelity movie script, High Fidelity film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Helping Rob in his task of musical elitism are Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), the \"musical moron twins,\" as he refers to them. Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, they compile \"top five\" lists for every conceivable occasion, openly mock the tastes of their customers, and, every so often, sell a few records.\nRob and the staff have a strong dislike for two shoplifting skateboarder teenagers, Vince (Chris Rehmann) and Justin (Ben Carr).

He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus. He observes that she is a \"career woman\" and that her field, market research, is a fine avocation for a woman and states that he once dated a librarian from Sussex. Kate dismisses him and demands that he take Stuart's dog...\n\n<html>\n<head><title>9 Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"9 script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"9 script, 9 movie script, 9 film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette\u00a0\u2013 the dummy created by 9...\n\n<html>\n<head><title>High Fidelity Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"High Fidelity script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"High Fidelity script, High Fidelity movie script, High Fidelity film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

After getting dumped by his latest girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), he decides to look up some of his old partners in an attempt to figure out where he keeps going wrong in his relationships.\nHe spends his days at his record store, Championship Vinyl, where he holds court over the customers that drift through. Helping Rob in his task of musical elitism are Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), the \"musical moron twins,\" as he refers to them. Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, they compile \"top five\" lists for every conceivable occasion, openly mock the tastes of their customers, and, every so often, sell a few records.\nRob and the staff have a strong dislike for two shoplifting skateboarder teenagers, Vince (Chris Rehmann) and Justin (Ben Carr). One day, he listens to a recording that they made and offers them a record deal, starting his own label called Top 5 Records. During his off hours, he pines for Laura and does his best to win her back.\nRob soon hears that Laura's father, who liked Rob, has died, and attends his funeral with Laura. Shortly after the reception, Rob realizes he never committed to Laura and always had one foot out the door. This made him realize he neglected his own future in the process. Afterward, he and Laura move back in together again. Rob meets a music columnist whom he soon develops a crush on, but while making a mixtape for her, wonders if he'll always just be jumping rock to rock. Laura meets with Rob in a bar where he explains how other girls are just fantasies, and while Laura is a reality, he never gets tired of her. He then proposes marriage to her, and she thanks him for asking. Later, she organizes an evening where he has the opportunity to revisit a love of his youth: dee-jaying. It is also a celebration of the recently released single by the two delinquents, where Barry's band plays \"Let's Get It On\". Surprised that Barry's band is not a...'}\n\nAnswer the question using the information given in the synopsis below.\n\n A vampire named Louis tells his 200-year-long life story to a reporter referred to simply as \"the boy\" (the character's name is revealed to be Daniel Molloy in The Queen of the Damned). In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump...\n\nQuestion: What does the boy who is interviewing Louis want?", "result": "According to the given summary, the boy who is interviewing Louis (Daniel Molloy) wants to know Louis' 200-year-long life story."}

The drainpipe was 50 metres long and led to the waters of Hawkes Bay, on the east coast of New Zealands North Island.\nIt is also possible that Inky escaped by squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain.

Tourist numbers have reduced by 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up, with a population of around 200 people. Even people born here and living in Athens, who have their own places on the island, arent coming.\nKakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may be too late for this season on an island where tourism is the main source of income: We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to  nd a room and we cant help them. A hard winter ahead may be slightly improved because 50 workers will live and work in the village to expand the harbour. But there is an even bigger crisis ahead because the government has said it will end a tax break for islands.\nThe tax break was created to help island communities survive the problem of mass emigration. The lower sales tax reduced the costs of living on the islands, where everything had to be imported and it made tourism more affordable. Tourist favourites such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with Turkey. But, for Agios Efstratios, it is a far greater problem.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.

{"prompt_new": "What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the man who had a memorial concert played in February 1931 after his death in December 1930? death in February 1931? from the following article ?\n\nIn September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...\n{'Response': 'Heseltine'}\n\nThe answer to the question: What is the full name of the person Patian agrees to remove the handcuffs for? is inside the article: Taxi driver Joe Lourik gets into an argument with a finance company over payments owed on his new cab.

Escaping with a pair of handcuffs still attached, he jumps on a passing freight train where he meets a tramp who tells him to see Patian, a thief and a fence in San Diego, who can also remove his handcuffs. After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery. After the robbery, Patian sends Joe north to a boarding house in Sacramento to wait for his share of the take, but the boarding house owner informs Joe that Patian isn't good for the money. \nDesperate for bus fare to return to San Diego to get his money from Patian, Joe considers robbing the cash register of the empty storefront of a downtown Sacramento flower shop. Once in the store, clerk Laura Benson emerges from the backroom before Joe can rob the register. Joe falls in love immediately and decides to go straight. With his winnings from a crap game, Joe buys a garage in Amesville and settles down, however, within a year, the police are on his trail. Joe then travels to San Diego to demand his money from Patian, but Patian's thugs force Joe to rob a post office. Desperate, and afraid that he will be caught if he returns home, Joe disappears.\nSome time later, Joe sees a picture of his newborn baby in the newspaper and meets with Laura, who pleads with Joe to give himself up and serve his time so that he can continue his new life.

The movie's main plot centers upon Frank Stewart, a television reporter that has decided to broadcast himself live as he and four other people (including the cameraman) investigate the Webber House, the site of the brutal murder of a husband and wife. Donald Webber, the suspected murderer and the couple's son, claims that he was commanded to murder his parents by demonic entities that he accidentally summoned using a Ouija board. Since that day, the house has been reported to be haunted and an anonymous police officer testifies that he and other fellow police officers have witnessed paranormal activity at the house. Frank initially treats the broadcast as a novelty, even going so far as to dismiss the concerns of paranormal investigators Louis and Claire Berger (Brian St. August and Helenmary Ball), as Claire immediately states that the house contains a menacing presence and that they are in danger as long as they are in the house. He tries to dissuade fears by bringing in Father Joseph Matheson, who Frank claims is versed in Catholic exorcism rites, despite the priest's assertion that he only has a perfunctory knowledge of the rites and has never actually performed an exorcism.\n#Response#\nFrank Stewart\n\nThe answer to the question: Who are the dog in Fagin's gang? is inside the article: On Fifth Avenue, an orphaned kitten named Oliver is left abandoned after his fellow orphaned kittens are adopted by passersby. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, Oliver meets a laid-back mongrel named Dodger who assists the kitten in stealing food from a hot dog vendor named Louie. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until he eventually arrives at the barge of his owner, a pickpocket named Fagin, along with his meal, to give to his friends: Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Rita the Saluki, and Francis the bulldog. Oliver sneaks inside, located below the docks, and is discovered by the dogs. After a moment of confusion, he is then received with a warm welcome. Fagin comes in and explains that he is running out of time to repay the money he borrowed from Sykes, a nefarious shipyard agent and loan shark. Sykes tells Fagin that the money must be paid in three days, under the threat of resolving to violence. Sykes's dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, attack Oliver, but the cat is defended by Fagin's dogs. Immediately thereafter, a depressed Fagin returns to the barge, lamenting that he only has three days to find the money he owes Sykes.

{"prompt_new": "On 31 October 1517, Martin Luther supposedly nailed his 95 theses against the selling of indulgences at the door of the All Saints', the Castle Church in Wittenberg. The theses debated and criticised the Church and the papacy, but concentrated upon the selling of indulgences and doctrinal policies about purgatory, particular judgment, and the authority of the pope. He would later write works on the Catholic devotion to Virgin Mary, the intercession of and devotion to the saints, the sacraments, mandatory clerical celibacy, monasticism, further on the authority of the pope, the ecclesiastical law, censure and excommunication, the role of secular rulers in religious matters, the relationship between Christianity and the law, good works, and the sacraments.\n\nQ: Who did Martin Luther criticize in the 95 theses?\n\nA:\n#Response#\nthe Church and the papacy\n\nThe use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation, based on the overarching principle of sola scriptura (by scripture alone). This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible: that its teaching is needed for salvation (necessity); that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone (sufficiency); that everything taught in the Bible is correct (inerrancy); and that, by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin, believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself, though understanding is difficult, so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church (clarity).\n\nQ: What is the term for needing the Bible for salvation?\n\nA:\n#Response#\nnecessity\n\nFDR's New Deal programs often contained equal opportunity clauses stating \"no discrimination shall be made on account of race, color or creed\",:11 but the true forerunner to affirmative action was the Interior Secretary of the time, Harold L.
