{"prompt_new": "Context: On 21 September, 2015, Canadians Robert Hall and John Ridsdel, as well as Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad, and  Marites Flor; a Filipino woman, were abducted on Samai island near Davao. Ridsdel was beheaded by Abu Sayyaf on 25 April 2016 following a ransom deadline. ASG reportedly demanded more than $8.1 million for Ridsdel and the others. On 3 May, 2016, a video of the Ridsdel execution was released, along with new demands for the remaining hostages. A masked captor said, \"Note to the Philippine government and to the Canadian government: The lesson is clear. John Ridsdel has been beheaded. Now there are three remaining captives here. If you procrastinate once again the negotiations, we will behead this all anytime\". On 15 May, Hall  appeared in a new video, announcing that he and Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad would be decapitated at 3pm on Monday 13 June absent a ransom of $16 million. Both hostages wore orange coveralls, similar to hostages in videos produced by ISIL, to which Abu Sayyaf had previously pledged allegiance. The deadline passed. Hall was beheaded. On 24 June, Abu Sayyaf released Filipina Marites Flor. She was subsequently flown to Davao to meet President-elect Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte said he directed negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf. He did not elaborate. On 17 September, 2016, remaining hostage Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island.

While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56. At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or K\u014dain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. In Java, between 4 and 10 million r\u014dmusha , were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.

After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta.

The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback\u2014who were few in numbers\u2014were armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour.

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1 per cent , seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians. While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56. At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or K\u014dain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. In Java, between 4 and 10 million r\u014dmusha , were forced to work by the Japanese military.

After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal.

Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead.

Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead. Following a Ravens punt the Patriots drove all the way to the Ravens 2-yard line, but had to settle for a 20-yard field goal, making the score 30-21 early in the fourth quarter. The Ravens proceeded to drive...\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.  Can you tell me the answer?\nQuestion: How many points did the Ravens win by?\nAnswer:\nAI assistant: 1\n\nQuestion: Who did Vlad \u0162epe\u015f want mobilized?\nAnswer based on following passage.\n\nVlad \u0162epe\u015f asked the Hungarian king for assistance.  He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included \"not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents.\" Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000. The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback\u2014who were few in numbers\u2014were armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour. Vlad's personal guard consisted of mercenaries from many countries and some Gypsies. Before battle, it is believed that Vlad told his men that \"it would be better that those who think of death should not follow me\".\n\nAnswer:\nBot: men of military age, women and of children, Gypsy slave contingents\n\nContext: Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Packers, the Vikings played their Week 2 home opener against the Indianapolis Colts. In the first half, kicker Ryan Longwell helped Minnesota take the early lead with a 45-yard and a 27-yard field goal in the first quarter, along with a 53-yard field goal in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the Vikes increased its lead with Longwell getting a 46-yard and a 28-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with RB Joseph Addai getting a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Indianapolis continued to gain ground as QB Peyton Manning completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, followed by a two-point conversion run by RB Dominic Rhodes. Later, the Colts sealed the win with kicker Adam Vinatieri nailing the game-winning 47-yard field goal.\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.  Can you tell me the answer?\nQuestion: How many field goals did Ryan Longwell kick?\nAnswer:", "result": "Based on the passage you provided, the answer to the question \"What happened first, a video of the Ridsdel execution being released or the release of Kjartan Sekkingstad?\" is:\n\nA video of the Ridsdel execution was released first, on 3 May 2016.

{"prompt_new": "Tell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: More Than 22% of Heart-Device Implantations Aren\u2019t In Line With Guidelines\n\nPassage: The story deserves high marks for bringing costs into the discussion right in the lead. \u201cIn more than 22% of cases, implantable defibrillators are given to heart patients who don\u2019t meet the guidelines for receiving the pricey devices, according to a study just published in JAMA.\u201d The story also says, \u201cICDs, which can cost north of $30,000, monitor the rhythm of the heart and produce a shock to bring irregular beating back to normal.\u201d But just as with the Times story, the cost of the device and hospitalizations is only a piece of the economic picture. Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits. This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied? And what is the bill that the 22.5% will not fit? The LA Times story examines the study in much clearer language and provides the right context. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. We spent some time on the fence...\nThe response of the bot is: likely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Pill Treats Painful Fibroids\n\nPassage: The story does not describe costs of the drug. The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids. Likewise, the Mirena IUD often stops bleeding altogether. NSAIDs can...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Heart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\n\nPassage: There is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story. The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug. (By digging into the research paper, via figure 3, we found that the benefits were measured by tracking absolute increases in\u00a0ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood pumped out the ventricles. It increased 8% in the group receiving a medium or high dose of the medicine.) One issue that might be confusing for readers: The story notes that a \u201cphase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why is the framing of the story about how effective it was? The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up. This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug\u2019s development. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said. But, as noted in quantify benefits criterion above, readers...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely true\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: New Tools for Helping Heart Patients\n\nPassage: \"Mixed bag. The story explained that the devices \"\"can cost as much as $30,000.\"\" And there was one data point from one study on one device that users\u2019 hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission. But the device costs are variable and device performance will be variable. We\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt but it painted the cost picture with really broad strokes. Information about the potential to increase longevity was presented from a study that has not yet been published. The information was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute increase. The story didn\u2019t contain sufficient information to quantify the benefit to any specific group of patients. The story did mention the problem of potential information overload however there was no discussion of actual harm such as inappropriate shocks from implanted defibrillator devices, for example. There was no questioning of the accuracy of the data potentially transmitted by devices. This was a far too rosy picture \u2013 almost as if all the data was so terrific that the only downside could be the volume of terrific data. Other things can go wrong as past experience shows when you try to regulate the heart. In our eyes, a red flag went up when the story cited \"\"a paper under review.\"\" We don\u2019t know the quality of the paper nor have peer reviewers completed their review yet. So that\u2019s giving the researcher free rein to say whatever he wants about that study. We also must address the headline which stated \u2018New tools for helping heart patients\u2019 before we have concrete demonstration that the new tools actually do help. The story opened with an anecdote that implied that something terrible was avoided. That, of course, is always hard to know. The punch line is that without the device reporting in to a clinician, the situation was one in which it \u00a0\"\"could have gone for months before the problem was discovered.\"\" The story never considered the question of whether there is always value in immediate recognition of a situation. Clinicians who were...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Seven presidents before (Barack Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans.\n\nPassage: \"President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law has been one of the most polarizing aspects of his presidency, with Republicans criticizing it at every turn. But the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, didn\u2019t run from it. He applauded Obama for pursuing expanded health care -- and succeeding where his predecessors had failed. \"\"Seven presidents before him -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans,\"\" Castro said. \"\"President Obama got it done.\"\" We wondered whether Castro\u2019s history was correct. So we checked with a variety of public policy and health care historians and found that Castro\u2019s in the ballpark -- but that a lot of caveats are in order. Let\u2019s start with the presidents who almost certainly fit Castro\u2019s definition of having \"\"tried to expand health care to all Americans.\"\" \u2022 Harry Truman. On Nov. 19, 1945, Truman wrote a message to Congress saying that \"\"the health of American children, like their education, should be recognized as a definite public responsibility.\"\" According to the Truman Library, \"\"the most controversial aspect of the plan was the proposed national health insurance plan.\"\" It called for \"\"the creation of a national health insurance fund to be run by the federal government. This fund would be open to all Americans, but would remain optional. Participants would pay monthly fees into the plan, which would cover the cost of any and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need.

It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works. We don\u2019t know how many participants were in each trial and who actually benefited from massage therapy. The release alludes to the fact several times that the immune system became stronger, but how was this measured? There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold.

Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided.

This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied? And what is the bill that the 22.5% will not fit? The LA Times story examines the study in much clearer language and provides the right context. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. We spent some time on the fence...\nThe response of the bot is: likely false\n\nAfter reading:\n\n The story does not describe costs of the drug. The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids.

While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug.

The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up.

A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size?

However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available.

Likewise, the Mirena IUD often stops bleeding altogether. NSAIDs can...\n\nbecause of:\n#Answer#\nFibroids are common and can cause bothersome symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and pressure in some women. However, they are also benign and deciding about how or whether to treatment them depends on how much a woman is bothered by her symptoms, feels about the pros and cons of different treatments, and whether she wishes to conserve her fertility. There are many different safe and viable treatments available, ranging from medications to minimally invasive procedures to surgery. Women who make a fully-informed decision about treatment in conjunction with their doctor are likely to be satisfied with their treatment so long as their choice matches their goals and what\u2019s important to them. Even with so many options, it would be welcome news that a drug may not just treat the symptoms but actually might reduce the size of fibroids. A new study presented at this week\u2019s European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology shows that EllaOne, currently available as an emergency contraceptive in Europe (but not in the US), may shrink fibroids and reduce symptoms relative to placebo. However, the results should be greeted cautiously. This was a small, short study and the full results have not been evaluated. More research is needed to confirm them and answer many outstanding questions. Whilet EllaOne may be shown to\u00a0 be very helpful to women with fibroids in the future, these results are\u00a0premature at best.\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Heart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\n\nPassage: There is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story. The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug. (By digging into the research paper, via figure 3, we found that the benefits were measured by tracking absolute increases in\u00a0ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood pumped out the ventricles. It increased 8% in the group receiving a medium or high dose of the medicine.) One issue that might be confusing for readers: The story notes that a \u201cphase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why is the framing of the story about how effective it was? The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up. This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug\u2019s development. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said.

But the device costs are variable and device performance will be variable. We\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt but it painted the cost picture with really broad strokes. Information about the potential to increase longevity was presented from a study that has not yet been published. The information was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute increase. The story didn\u2019t contain sufficient information to quantify the benefit to any specific group of patients. The story did mention the problem of potential information overload however there was no discussion of actual harm such as inappropriate shocks from implanted defibrillator devices, for example. There was no questioning of the accuracy of the data potentially transmitted by devices. This was a far too rosy picture \u2013 almost as if all the data was so terrific that the only downside could be the volume of terrific data. Other things can go wrong as past experience shows when you try to regulate the heart.

The story opened with an anecdote that implied that something terrible was avoided. That, of course, is always hard to know. The punch line is that without the device reporting in to a clinician, the situation was one in which it \u00a0\"\"could have gone for months before the problem was discovered.\"\" The story never considered the question of whether there is always value in immediate recognition of a situation.

It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works. We don\u2019t know how many participants were in each trial and who actually benefited from massage therapy. The release alludes to the fact several times that the immune system became stronger, but how was this measured? There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold.

{"prompt_new": "After reading:\n\n The story deserves high marks for bringing costs into the discussion right in the lead. \u201cIn more than 22% of cases, implantable defibrillators are given to heart patients who don\u2019t meet the guidelines for receiving the pricey devices, according to a study just published in JAMA.\u201d The story also says, \u201cICDs, which can cost north of $30,000, monitor the rhythm of the heart and produce a shock to bring irregular beating back to normal.\u201d But just as with the Times story, the cost of the device and hospitalizations is only a piece of the economic picture. Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits.

It also should have done a better job evaluating the evidence in this study but, instead, left reviewers \u2013 and, we bet, readers \u2013 confused. When a study this large finds that 1 out of every 5 people may have unnecessarily undergone a surgery that led to longer hospital stays in, in a minority, a shorter life, that\u2019s big news. Reporters need to make sure that they give readers the proper context to process findings this dramatic. Identifying the best candidates for ICD pacement is not an exact science. Guidelines have been developed to help clinicians and patients determine the best course of action. The guidelines are, at best, interpretations of existing information generated in clinical trials. While useful, they are by no means exact. The study in question examined data collected from a national registry on over 100,000 patients and concluded that 1/5th of the implants were outside existing guidelines. While the findings in the study are\u00a0troubling at face value, the story appears to be a bit more complicated. The accompanying editorial places the results in a slightly different perspective. Of the four criteria examined, only one (placement of the ICD in patients with severe heart failure) is an absolute.

I found the story very simple and full of clich\u00e9s, taking the 'social' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy. The lead actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman, she looks, acts and talks very much like a 'high-standing' woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor. The photography is ugly, not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times. The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The film-maker was by the door.

I've never told anyone about what happened at the fork in the stream that day, and I never will. I've decided to write it down, though, in this book, which I will leave on the table beside my bed. I can't write long, because my hands shake so these days and I have next to no strength, but I don't think it will take long. Later, someone may find what I have written. That seems likely to me, as it is pretty much human nature to look in a book marked \"Diary\" after its owner has passed along. So, yes -- my works will probably be read.

It was 1914, the summer after my brother, Dan, died in the West Field and not long before America got into the First World War. I've never told anyone about what happened at the fork in the stream that day, and I never will. I've decided to write it down, though, in this book, which I will leave on the table beside my bed. I can't write long, because my hands shake so these days and I have next to no strength, but I don't think it will take long. Later, someone may find what I have written. That seems likely to me, as it is pretty much human nature to look in a book marked \"Diary\" after its owner has passed along. So, yes -- my works will probably be read. A better question is whether anyone will believe them. Almost certainly not, but that doesn't matter. It's not belief I'm interested in but freedom. Writing can give that, I've found. For twenty years I wrote a column called \"Long Ago and Far Away\" for the Castle Rock Call, and I know that sometimes it works that way -- what you write down sometimes leaves you forever, like old photographs left in the bright sun, fading to nothing but white. I pray for that sort of release. A man in his eighties should be well past the terrors of childhood, but as my infirmities slowly creep up on me, like waves licking closer and closer to some indifferently built castle of sand, that terrible face grows clearer and clearer in my mind's eye. What I might have done yesterday, who I might have seen here in my room at the nursing home, what I might have said to them or they to me -- those things are gone, but the face of the man in the black suit grows ever clearer, ever closer, and I remember every word he said. I don't want to think of him, but I can't help it, and sometimes at night my old heart beats so hard and so fast I think it will tear...\n\nThe next word is: is.\n\n2. Isabeau!

I eased open the mahogany door and slipped inside, checking my hair to make sure it hadn't escaped its chignon. Mr. Drake sat on the edge of his desk facing the doorway, perched like a bird of prey. His wavy hair was perfectly in place, but his green eyes had a wild look behind them, like I was trying his last nerve. And maybe I was. \"Come here.\" His voice was dangerously low. I walked toward him slowly, suddenly feeling nervous. What if my plan backfired? What if instead of punishing me like last time, he just fired me instead? I swallowed, my mouth suddenly drier than a cotton ball. I stopped a couple of feet away from him, but he crooked his finger, beckoning me closer. I gulped and complied, moving forward until we were eye to eye, his gaze boring into me. He was so close now that I could smell the fresh scent of his aftershave just inches from my nose. \"What,\" he said, \"is this?\" He thrust a piece of paper in front of me, and I suppressed a smirk. The copy I'd made of the boardroom minutes was off center, the edge cut off in a way I knew was making him crazy. Mr. Drake was nothing if not a control freak. \"This is not the standard of work I require, Isabeau, and I think you know that. Where the hell is your head today?\" He grabbed my hand, making me jump, and shoved the wad of paper into it. \"Get this out of my sight and do it again.

We can do this by finding the remainder when 1078 is divided by 23:\n\n1078 \u00f7 23 = 46 with a remainder of 20\n\nSo, we need to add 3 to 1078 to make it divisible by 23.\n\n**Answer:** a) 3\n\n**Problem 2:**\nWhat will be the compound interest on a sum of Rs. 24,000 after 3 years at the rate of 12% p.a.?\n\nWe can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(n\\*t)\n\nwhere A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nP = Rs. 24,000\nr = 12% = 0.12\nn = 1 (compounded annually)\nt = 3 years\n\nA = 24000 (1 + 0.12/1)^(1*3)\nA = 24000 (1.12)^3\nA = 24000 * 1.3312\nA = Rs. 31,718.27\n\n**Answer:** a) Rs. 9718.27\n\n**Problem 3:**\nThe sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550. What is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive?\n\nWe can find the sum of the first 50 positive even integers using the formula:\n\n1 + 2 + ... + 100 = 2550\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with first term 1, last term 100, and number of terms 50. We can use the formula:\n\nSum = (n/2)(a1 + an)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nSum = (50/2)(1 + 100)\nSum = 25(101)\nSum = 2550\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400. This is an arithmetic series with first term 302, last term 400, and number of terms 50.\n\nSum = (50/2)(302 + 400)\nSum = 25(701)\nSum = 17,525\n\n**Answer:** c) 17,550\n\n**Problem 4:**\nThere are 8 teams in a certain league, and each team faces another team for a total of 12 times.

To find the maximum number of students, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1020 and 860.\n\nGCD(1020, 860) = 20\n\nSo, the maximum number of students is 1880 \u00f7 20 = 94.\n\n**Answer:** a) 20\n\n**Problem 6:**\nA dress on sale in a shop is marked at $d.

The correct answer is (a) Rs. 9718.27.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nThe sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550. What is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive?\n\nThe sum of the first 50 positive even integers is given by:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100 = 2550\n\nWe can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = n(a1 + an) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, n = 50, a1 = 2, and an = 100. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nSum = 50(2 + 100) / 2 = 2550\n\nTo find the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive, we can use the same formula. The first term is a1 = 302, the last term is an = 400, and the number of terms is n = 50 (since there are 50 even integers between 302 and 400 inclusive). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nSum = 50(302 + 400) / 2 = 51,000\n\nThe correct answer is not among the options.\n\n**Problem 4:**\nThere are 8 teams in a certain league, and each team faces another team for a total of 12 times. How many games are played in the season?\n\nEach team plays 7 other teams (since there are 8 teams in total). Since each game is played twice (once for each team), the total number of games is:\n\n8C2 \\* 12 = 56\n\nHowever, this counts each game twice (since each game is played twice). To correct for this, we divide by 2:\n\n56 / 2 = 28\n\nThe correct answer is (c) 28.\n\n**Problem 5:**\nThe maximum number of students among them 1020 pens and 860 pencils can be distributed in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens and same number of pencils is:\n\nWe can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1020 and 860 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1020 = 860 \\* 1 + 160\n860 = 160 \\* 5 + 60\n160 = 60 \\* 2 + 40\n60 = 40 \\* 1 + 20\n40 = 20 \\* 2\n\nThe GCD is 20. Therefore, the maximum number of students that can receive the same number of pens and pencils is 20.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) 20.\n\n**Problem 6:**\nA dress on sale in a shop is marked at $d. During the discount sale, its price is reduced by 25%. Staff are allowed a further 20% reduction on the discounted price. If a staff member buys the dress, what will she have to pay in terms of d?\n\nFirst, the dress is reduced by 25%:\n\nPrice = d - (0.25d) = 0.75d\n\nThen, the staff member gets a further 20% reduction:\n\nPrice = 0.75d - (0.20"}

To find the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive, we can use the formula:\n\nSum = (n/2)(a1 + an)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nn = 50, a1 = 302, an = 400\n\nSum = (50/2)(302 + 400) = 25(702) = 17,550\n\nFor the fourth problem:\n\nThere are 8 teams, and each team faces another team for a total of 12 times. How many games are played in the season?\n\nThe answer is c) 144.\n\nEach team faces 7 other teams (since there are 8 teams), and each match is played twice (once as home team and once as away team). So, the total number of matches played by each team is 7 x 2 = 14. Since there are 8 teams, the total number of matches played is 8 x 14 = 112. However, this counts each match twice (once as home team and once as away team), so we need to divide the total by 2 to get the actual number of games played. 112/2 = 56. Since each match is played between two teams, the total number of games played is 56 x 2 = 112. However, this is still not the correct answer, since we need to account for the fact that each game is played twice (once as home team and once as away team). To correct for this, we need to divide the total number of games played by 2 again. 112/2 = 56, and 56/2 = 28. Since there are 28 games played, and each game is played twice, the total number of games played is 28 x 2 = 56."}

What is the least number that must be added to 1078 so that the sum is completely divisible by 23?\n\nTo solve this problem, we can find the remainder of 1078 when divided by 23. The remainder is 11. Therefore, we need to add 12 (since 23 - 11 = 12) to 1078 to make it divisible by 23.\n\nThe correct answer is (a) 3.\n\n2. What will be the compound interest on a sum of Rs. 24,000 after 3 years at the rate of 12% p.a.?\n\nThis is a compound interest problem.

The number of terms is 50.\n\nSum = 50/2 (302 + 400)\n= 25(702)\n= 17,550\n\nThe correct answer is (c) 17,550.\n\n4. There are 8 teams in a certain league, and each team faces another team for a total of 12 times. How many games are played in the season?\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the formula for the number of combinations:\n\nNumber of combinations = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the number of teams, k is the number of teams in each combination, and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nIn this case, n = 8, and k = 2. The number of combinations is:\n\nNumber of combinations = 8! / (2!(8-2)!)\n= 8! / (2!6!)\n= 28\n\nSince each combination represents a game, the total number of games played is:\n\nNumber of games = 28 * 12\n= 336\n\nThe correct answer is (c) 336.\n\n5.

Mrs. Caroline Liscom was furious that her house was soaked with water when the smoke was only caused by her chimney, and as a result was rude to her new boarders. Mrs. Jameson tried to find a new place to live in response to her host's rudeness, but had no such luck and both families were forced to live under the roof for the next several weeks.\nThe Jamesons consisted of a mother, a father, two daughters, one son and a grandmother.

Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her. The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her.\nWhen she is threatened with burning at the stake, she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment.\nAs the jailer shaves her head, she realises she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession.\nAs more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit. As the flames rise the women weep and a man cries out \"you have burned a saint\". The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan the troops and crowd clash and people are killed.

His strict uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) has no patience for his disrespect for the monarchy, chastising him and telling him he must marry a rich American, as the Mountbatten family finances are depleted. After his uncle told him that on his \"thirtieth birthday he had become a blemish to the family name\", Leopold counters that the new nobility is to be found in those who pursue initiatives, hence his interest in the sciences.\nOne day, the Duke finds Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), an amateur physicist (and descendant of Leopold) in his study perusing his schematic diagrams and taking photographs of them. He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus.

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette\u00a0\u2013 the dummy created by 9...\n\nQuestion: What does 5's soul do before returning to his rag doll skin?\nBot: He gives 9 a nod of approval.\n\nAnswer the question using the information given in the synopsis below.\n\n Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is a self-confessed music loving everyman with a poor understanding of women.

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump...\n\nQuestion: What does the boy who is interviewing Louis want?", "result": "The answer is not explicitly stated in the synopsis, but based on the context, it can be inferred that the boy wants to learn about Louis' life story and the secrets of the vampire world."}

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette\u00a0\u2013 the dummy created by 9...\n\nQuestion: What does 5's soul do before returning to his rag doll skin?\nBot: It turns to 9 and nods in approval\n\n<html>\n<head><title>High Fidelity Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"High Fidelity script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"High Fidelity script, High Fidelity movie script, High Fidelity film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump...\n\nQuestion: What does the boy who is interviewing Louis want?", "result": "I can help you with that!\n\nAccording to the synopsis, the boy (later revealed to be Daniel Molloy) wants to hear Louis' 200-year-long life story."}

Their arrival caused a great commotion as the Jamesons son, Cobb, saw smoke inside his new temporary residence and proceeded to run outside and yell \u201cFire!\u201d Word quickly traveled down the street and a crowd formed outside the Liscom's as firemen drenched the entire house. Mrs. Caroline Liscom was furious that her house was soaked with water when the smoke was only caused by her chimney, and as a result was rude to her new boarders. Mrs. Jameson tried to find a new place to live in response to her host's rudeness, but had no such luck and both families were forced to live under the roof for the next several weeks.\nThe Jamesons consisted of a mother, a father, two daughters, one son and a grandmother. Mrs. Jameson quickly gave her family a bad reputation at a Linnville annual picnic several days after her arrival. She made an announcement to the village that their unhealthy foods were \u201cpoison\u201d and further insults them as she says that their rich pies and cakes causes the insanity and dyspepsia in people of their social class, so they should only eat the health foods she consumes. In attempt to avoid an altercation, the people of Linnville respond as politely as possible and continue on with the picnic as though nothing happened.\nMrs. Jameson proceeds to insult the women of the village at their next meeting - the Ladies' Sewing Circle. It is at this meeting that the women become aware that Mrs. Jameson is trying to improve the women as she interrupts the meeting to \u201cimprove their minds and enlarge their spheres\u201d by reading passages from Robert Browning. The women are not entertained by her reading, but once again are respectful when she is done lecturing them.\nSeveral weeks later, the Jamesons return to the city for the winter and the next chapter begins their second summer in Linnville.

Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her. The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her.\nWhen she is threatened with burning at the stake, she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment.\nAs the jailer shaves her head, she realises she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession.\nAs more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit. As the flames rise the women weep and a man cries out \"you have burned a saint\". The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan the troops and crowd clash and people are killed.

His strict uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) has no patience for his disrespect for the monarchy, chastising him and telling him he must marry a rich American, as the Mountbatten family finances are depleted. After his uncle told him that on his \"thirtieth birthday he had become a blemish to the family name\", Leopold counters that the new nobility is to be found in those who pursue initiatives, hence his interest in the sciences.\nOne day, the Duke finds Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), an amateur physicist (and descendant of Leopold) in his study perusing his schematic diagrams and taking photographs of them. He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus.

Afterward, he and Laura move back in together again. Rob meets a music columnist whom he soon develops a crush on, but while making a mixtape for her, wonders if he'll always just be jumping rock to rock. Laura meets with Rob in a bar where he explains how other girls are just fantasies, and while Laura is a reality, he never gets tired of her. He then proposes marriage to her, and she thanks him for asking. Later, she organizes an evening where he has the opportunity to revisit a love of his youth: dee-jaying.

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump...\n\nQuestion: What does the boy who is interviewing Louis want?", "result": "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nAccording to the synopsis, the boy (who is later revealed to be Daniel Molloy) is a reporter who is interviewing Louis, a vampire, and wants to hear his 200-year-long life story."}
{"prompt_new": "Below is the summary of a document.\n\n The residents of Linnville prided themselves on the lack of tourism and absence of a summer hotel. Never having boarders before, the Liscom family, accepted the Jamesons when they came to town in search for a place to stay. Their arrival caused a great commotion as the Jamesons son, Cobb, saw smoke inside his new temporary residence and proceeded to run outside and yell \u201cFire!\u201d Word quickly traveled down the street and a crowd formed outside the Liscom's as firemen drenched the entire house. Mrs. Caroline Liscom was furious that her house was soaked with water when the smoke was only caused by her chimney, and as a result was rude to her new boarders. Mrs. Jameson tried to find a new place to live in response to her host's rudeness, but had no such luck and both families were forced to live under the roof for the next several weeks.\nThe Jamesons consisted of a mother, a father, two daughters, one son and a grandmother. Mrs. Jameson quickly gave her family a bad reputation at a Linnville annual picnic several days after her arrival. She made an announcement to the village that their unhealthy foods were \u201cpoison\u201d and further insults them as she says that their rich pies and cakes causes the insanity and dyspepsia in people of their social class, so they should only eat the health foods she consumes. In attempt to avoid an altercation, the people of Linnville respond as politely as possible and continue on with the picnic as though nothing happened.\nMrs. Jameson proceeds to insult the women of the village at their next meeting - the Ladies' Sewing Circle. It is at this meeting that the women become aware that Mrs. Jameson is trying to improve the women as she interrupts the meeting to \u201cimprove their minds and enlarge their spheres\u201d by reading passages from Robert Browning. The women are not entertained by her reading, but once again are respectful when she is done lecturing them.\nSeveral weeks later, the Jamesons return to the city for the winter and the next chapter begins their second summer in Linnville. For...\n\nWhat is the answer to the following query?\n\nWhat do the residents of Linnville pride themselves on?\nAnswer: the town's lack of tourism or a summer hotel\n\nAnswer the question using the information given in the synopsis below.\n\n After having led numerous military battles against the English during the Hundred Years' War, Joan of Arc is captured near Compiegne and eventually brought to Rouen, Normandy to stand trial for heresy by French clergymen loyal to the English.\nOn 30 May 1431 Joan is interrogated by the French clerical court. Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her. The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her.\nWhen she is threatened with burning at the stake, she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment.\nAs the jailer shaves her head, she realises she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession.\nAs more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit. As the flames rise the women weep and a man cries out \"you have burned a saint\". The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan the troops and crowd clash and people are killed. Joan is consumed by the flames but they protect her soul as it rises to heaven.\n\nQuestion: What did Joan think her mission was?\nBot: Drive the English from France.\n\nState the main points mentioned in the below text.\n\n<html>\n<head><title>Kate & Leopold Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Kate & Leopold script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Kate & Leopold script, Kate & Leopold movie script, Kate & Leopold film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

His strict uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) has no patience for his disrespect for the monarchy, chastising him and telling him he must marry a rich American, as the Mountbatten family finances are depleted. After his uncle told him that on his \"thirtieth birthday he had become a blemish to the family name\", Leopold counters that the new nobility is to be found in those who pursue initiatives, hence his interest in the sciences.\nOne day, the Duke finds Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), an amateur physicist (and descendant of Leopold) in his study perusing his schematic diagrams and taking photographs of them. He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus. He observes that she is a \"career woman\" and that her field, market research, is a fine avocation for a woman and states that he once dated a librarian from Sussex. Kate dismisses him and demands that he take Stuart's dog...\n\n<html>\n<head><title>9 Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"9 script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"9 script, 9 movie script, 9 film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette\u00a0\u2013 the dummy created by 9...\n\n<html>\n<head><title>High Fidelity Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"High Fidelity script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"High Fidelity script, High Fidelity movie script, High Fidelity film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

I dont think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, because octopuses are solitary creatures. But, he is such a curious boy. He wanted to know what was happening on the outside. Thats just his personality.\nOne theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor  a journey of three or four metres  and, then, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea. The drainpipe was 50 metres long and led to the waters of Hawkes Bay, on the east coast of New Zealands North Island.\nIt is also possible that Inky escaped by squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain. When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised, said Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. The staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and hes always been a bit of a surprise octopus.\nReiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky was not stolen. I understand octopus behaviour very well, he said. I have seen octopuses on boats escape through bilge pumps.

She was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the BBC Urdu service describing her experiences of struggling to get an education under the rising power of Taliban militants.\nBy 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the US special representative to Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, to use his influence against the Talibans efforts to stop education for girls.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930.

After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery. After the robbery, Patian sends Joe north to a boarding house in Sacramento to wait for his share of the take, but the boarding house owner informs Joe that Patian isn't good for the money. \nDesperate for bus fare to return to San Diego to get his money from Patian, Joe considers robbing the cash register of the empty storefront of a downtown Sacramento flower shop.

Donald Webber, the suspected murderer and the couple's son, claims that he was commanded to murder his parents by demonic entities that he accidentally summoned using a Ouija board.

The country's trade surplus has increased to a record high, but this is partly due to a decline in exports. The Chinese government is trying to shift the economy towards being more consumer-led, but the decline in imports suggests that domestic demand is not strong enough. The government has set a target of 6% trade growth, but the actual growth rate has been 8% lower than that in the first 10 months of the year.\n\n**Article 2: Iran's Missile Test**\n\nIran has tested a medium-range ballistic missile, which the US has condemned as a \"clear violation\" of UN sanctions. The missile has a range of 1,700 km and is considered to be more reliable than earlier versions. The US has expressed concern over Iran's missile program and has called for the UN Security Council to take action. However, it is unlikely that the test will derail the recent nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers.\n\n**Article 3: UK Public Sector Pay**\n\nPublic sector workers in the UK, such as firefighters, teachers, and paramedics, are thousands of pounds worse off than they were in 2010 due to inflation outpacing pay rises. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is calling for an increase in pay to match inflation, as workers are struggling to make ends meet. The Chancellor has argued that public sector workers receive a 10% \"premium\" over their private sector counterparts, but the TUC disputes this claim.\n\n**Article 4: X Factor Winners**\n\nThe article looks back at the winners of the UK TV show \"The X Factor\" and what they have achieved since winning the competition. The article highlights the success of previous winners, including Ben Haenow, Sam Bailey, James Arthur, Little Mix, and Matt Cardle.\n\n**Article 5: Hospital Transfer Delay**\n\nA 76-year-old man was left waiting for almost nine hours for a hospital transfer after being discharged from a stroke treatment. The patient's daughter was left frustrated and upset by the delay, which she described as \"unacceptable\". The ambulance company, Arriva, apologized for the delay and is working to improve its service.\n\n**Article 6: Rugby Player**\n\nRugby player Greig Tonks has joined London Irish on a deal until the end of the season. He has been playing for the team since last month and has helped them climb away from the bottom of the table. Tonks hopes to get a regular run of games and improve his chances of being recalled to the Scotland national team."}
