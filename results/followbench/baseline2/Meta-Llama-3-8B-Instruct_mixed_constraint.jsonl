{"prompt_new": "Prompt: Lost, found vodka, drank to forget.\n\nAccording to the above prompt, write a story that describes a man.", "result": "The man, a ruggedly handsome individual in his mid-30s, had always been a free spirit. He had a way of living life on his own terms, never one to be tied down by the conventions of society. His hair was a wild tangle of brown locks, his eyes a piercing blue that seemed to hold a thousand stories. His features were chiseled, as if carved from the rugged landscape of the mountains he loved to hike.\n\nBut despite his rugged exterior, there was a depth to him, a sense of vulnerability that he only revealed to those closest to him. He had a way of carrying himself with a quiet confidence, as if he knew that he was capable of overcoming any obstacle that came his way.\n\nIt was this confidence that had led him to make some questionable decisions in the past, decisions that had left him lost and alone in the wilderness of his own making. But he had always been one to learn from his mistakes, to use them as opportunities to grow and become a better version of himself.\n\nAnd so, when he stumbled upon a lost bottle of vodka in the woods, he knew that it was a sign, a sign that it was time to confront the demons that had been haunting him for so long. He drank to forget, to drown out the voices in his head that told him he was a failure, that he was unworthy of love.\n\nAs the liquor coursed through his veins, he felt a sense of freedom wash over him, a sense of release from the burdens that had been weighing him down. He laughed, a deep, throaty laugh that echoed through the trees, as he realized that he was not alone, that he was part of something much larger than himself.\n\nAnd so, he continued to drink, to lose himself in the haze of the vodka, to forget the pain and the heartache that had left him feeling lost and alone. For in the end, it was not the vodka that had found him, but he who had found the vodka, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope, always a chance to start anew."}

{"prompt_new": "Summarize this news into 3 sentences:\n\nLONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported \u00a320 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films. Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest \u00bb . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME).  We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing. The code, dataset, visualizations, and an interactive demo notebook are available in the supplemental materials.", "result": "Here is a summary of the text in one sentence:\n\nResearchers analyze the storage and recall of factual associations in autoregressive transformer language models and find that localized, directly-editable computations in mid-layer feed-forward modules are responsible for storing and recalling these associations, and demonstrate a method called Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) that can effectively update these associations and improve model performance on zero-shot relation extraction and counterfactual assertion tasks."}
