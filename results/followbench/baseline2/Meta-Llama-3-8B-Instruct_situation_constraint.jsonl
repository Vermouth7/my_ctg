The list comprehension `[x for x in set(l) if l.count(x) == 1]` iterates over the set and keeps only the elements that appear only once in the original list. `l.count(x) == 1` checks if the element appears only once in the list.\n3.

The `set` data structure automatically removes duplicates, so we only get unique elements.\n\n2. `[x for i in l if l.count(i) == n]`: This is a list comprehension that creates a list of elements from `l` that appear exactly `n` times.\n\n3. `sorted(...)`: This function sorts the list in ascending order.\n\nHere's how you can use the function:\n\n```Python\nprint(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1))  # Output: [0, 2, 9, 123]\n```\n\nThis function will return a list with elements that appear exactly `n` times in the given list, sorted in ascending order."}

The `Counter` function from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each element in the input list `l`.\n2.

Given your recent transition from an internship to a full-time role and taking on multiple projects, here are some tips to help you improve your time management skills:\n\n1. **Prioritize tasks**: Make a to-do list and prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. Focus on the most critical tasks first, and break them down into smaller, manageable chunks. Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks into four quadrants: urgent & important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and not urgent or important.\n2. **Set realistic goals and deadlines**: Establish clear goals and deadlines for each project and task. Be realistic about what you can accomplish in a day or a week. Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals to help you stay focused and motivated.\n3. **Use a scheduling tool**: Utilize a scheduling tool like Google Calendar, Trello, or Asana to organize your tasks and deadlines. Block out dedicated time for each task, and set reminders and notifications to stay on track.\n4. **Create a daily routine**: Establish a consistent daily routine that includes dedicated time for work, breaks, and self-care. Prioritize your most important tasks during your most productive hours, and schedule breaks to recharge and avoid burnout.\n5. **Focus on one task at a time**: Multitasking can be detrimental to productivity. Focus on one task at a time to ensure you complete it efficiently and effectively. Use the Pomodoro Technique: work for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, and repeat.\n6. **Learn to say no**: Don't take on too much at once. Be mindful of your workload and learn to say no to non-essential tasks that may interfere with your priorities. Communicate with your team and manager about your capacity and limitations.\n7. **Take breaks and practice self-care**: Working long hours without breaks can lead to burnout. Take regular breaks to recharge, exercise, and practice self-care. Schedule time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax.\n8. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your progress, goals, and priorities. Adjust your schedule and tasks as needed to stay on track and adapt to changing project requirements.\n9. **Communicate with your team and manager**: Keep your team and manager informed about your progress, challenges, and changes. This will help you stay accountable, avoid misunderstandings, and ensure everyone is aligned with your goals and deadlines.\n10. **Continuously learn and improve**: Time management is a skill that takes practice. Continuously evaluate your time management strategy, and be willing to adjust and improve it as needed. Seek feedback from colleagues, mentors, or a productivity coach to help you optimize your approach.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you'll be better equipped to manage your time effectively, deliver high-quality work, and thrive in your new role as a software engineer at a fast-paced tech startup."}

The `BankAccount` class has the basic features:\n\t* `__init__`: takes an account number and an optional balance (default to 0).\n\t* `deposit`: allows depositing a positive amount, updating the balance, and returning a message with the new balance.\n\t* `withdraw`: allows withdrawing a positive amount (if the balance is sufficient) and updating the balance. Returns a message with the new balance or an error message if the withdrawal is invalid.\n\t* `get_balance`: returns the account balance.\n2. The `SavingsAccount` class inherits from `BankAccount` and adds the following feature:\n\t* `__init__`: takes an account number, an optional balance (default to 0), and an optional interest rate (default to 0.02).\n\t* `apply_interest`: calculates the interest based on the interest rate and adds it to the balance. Returns a message with the interest amount and the new balance.\n\nYou can use these classes to create bank accounts and perform transactions like this:\n```\naccount = SavingsAccount(12345, 1000, 0.03)  # create a savings account with account number 12345, initial balance 1000, and interest rate 0.03\nprint(account.get_balance())  # prints 1000.0\n\naccount.deposit(500)  # deposit 500\nprint(account.get_balance())  # prints 1500.0\n\naccount.withdraw(200)  # withdraw 200\nprint(account.get_balance())  # prints 1300.0\n\naccount.apply_interest()  # add interest\nprint(account.get_balance())  # prints 1326.00\n\naccount.withdraw(1500)  # try to withdraw more than the balance\nprint(account.get_balance())  # prints 826.0\n```\nNote that the `SavingsAccount` class inherits the `BankAccount` methods, so you can use them as well."}
