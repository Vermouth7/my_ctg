Break down large goals into smaller, manageable tasks to help you stay focused.\n2. **Use a planner or calendar**: Write down all your tasks, appointments, and deadlines in a planner or calendar. This will help you stay organized and ensure that you don't forget important tasks or appointments.\n3. **Prioritize tasks**: Identify the most important and urgent tasks and prioritize them accordingly. Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks into four quadrants: urgent & important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and not urgent or important.\n4. **Use time-blocking**: Schedule large blocks of uninterrupted time to focus on important tasks. This technique is called time-blocking. Set a timer for 90-120 minutes and work on a single task without any distractions during that time.\n5. **Take breaks**: Take regular breaks to recharge and avoid burnout. Use the Pomodoro Technique: work for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, and repeat.\n6. **Avoid multitasking**: Focus on one task at a time to ensure you complete it efficiently and effectively. Multitasking can lead to distractions and decreased productivity.\n7. **Use a mind map**: Create a mind map to visually organize your tasks, ideas, and projects. Start with a central idea or goal and branch out to related tasks, subtasks, and deadlines. This will help you see the big picture and stay focused on your goals.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a mind map for time management:\n\n**Central idea:** \"Weekly Tasks\"\n\n**Branch 1:** \"Work\"\n\n* **Subtask 1:** \"Project X deadline: March 15th\"\n\t+ Deadline: March 10th\n\t+ Task: Research and write report\n* **Subtask 2:** \"Meeting with John on Friday\"\n\t+ Time: 2 PM\n\t+ Agenda: Discuss project progress\n\n**Branch 2:** \"Personal\"\n\n* **Subtask 1:** \"Grocery shopping\"\n\t+ Time: Saturday morning\n\t+ List: Milk, bread, eggs\n* **Subtask 2:** \"Exercise routine\"\n\t+ Time: Monday, Wednesday, Friday\n\t+ Schedule: 30-minute walk\n\n**Branch 3:** \" Errands\"\n\n* **Subtask 1:** \"Pay bills\"\n\t+ Deadline: March 20th\n\t+ Online payment\n* **Subtask 2:** \"Pick up dry cleaning\"\n\t+ Time: Wednesday afternoon\n\t+ Location: Dry cleaner's shop\n\nBy using a mind map, you can visually organize your tasks, prioritize them, and see the relationships between them.

Introduction 2. Main Argument 3. Conclusion\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint#\n**Introduction**\n\nIn today's digital age, the rise of digital cameras and mobile phones has revolutionized the way people capture and share their memories. With the convenience and high-quality outputs offered by these devices, it's no wonder that film photography has become a niche interest. However, despite the dominance of digital technology, many photographers and enthusiasts continue to prefer film photography. This preference is not just a nostalgic throwback to the past, but rather a deliberate choice that is driven by a range of factors, including aesthetics, tactile experience, and creative control.\n\n**Main Argument**\n\nThere are several reasons why film photography remains a popular choice among many photographers, despite the convenience and high-quality outputs of digital cameras and mobile phones.\n\n1. **Aesthetics**: Film photography offers a unique aesthetic that is often described as more organic, textured, and nuanced compared to digital images. The grain, contrast, and color palette of film can create a distinctive look that is difficult to replicate with digital cameras. Many photographers appreciate the unique character that film imparts to their images, making them stand out in a sea of digital mediocrity.\n2. **Tactile experience**: Shooting with film requires a level of physical interaction and engagement that is often missing from digital photography. The process of loading film, setting aperture and shutter speed, and waiting for the results can be a meditative and satisfying experience. The tactile nature of film photography encourages photographers to slow down, think more carefully about their shots, and develop a deeper connection with their craft.\n3. **Creative control**: Film photography offers a level of creative control that is unmatched by digital cameras. With film, photographers have to think carefully about each shot, as they are limited by the number of exposures on a roll. This constraint can lead to a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to photography, resulting in more considered and artistic images.\n4. **Nostalgia and tradition**: For many photographers, film photography is a nod to the past, a way to connect with the history of photography and the photographers who came before them. Shooting with film can be a way to pay homage to the pioneers of photography and to experience the thrill of discovery that came with developing one's own film.\n5. **Community and camaraderie**: The film photography community is a tight-knit and supportive group, with many photographers sharing their passion and knowledge with one another. Shooting with film can be a way to connect with like-minded individuals who share a love for the craft.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the preference for film photography in an era dominated by digital cameras and mobile phones is not just a nostalgic throwback to the past, but a deliberate choice driven by a range of factors. The unique aesthetic, tactile experience, creative control, nostalgia, and community of film photography all contribute to its enduring appeal. While digital cameras and mobile phones may offer convenience and high-quality outputs, they cannot replicate the distinctive qualities and experiences that film photography provides. For those who value the art of photography as much as the end result, film photography remains a compelling and rewarding choice.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify the 1 added constraint.\n2) Please descriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# satisfies the 1 added constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 1 element ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies the 1 added constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The added constraint is to structure the response in a specific hierarchy: 1.

Despite the ease and immediacy of digital photography, many photographers and enthusiasts are drawn to the unique aesthetic and tactile experience of shooting with film. This inclination towards film photography is not solely driven by nostalgia, but rather by a desire for a more deliberate and creative process, as well as a distinct visual quality that digital cameras cannot replicate.\n\n**Main Argument (approx. 200 words)**\n\nThe primary appeal of film photography lies in its ability to encourage a more mindful and intentional approach to capturing images. With film, photographers must carefully consider each shot, as the cost of mistakes is higher and the results are less immediate. This forces photographers to slow down and think more critically about their composition, lighting, and subject matter. Additionally, the unpredictability of film's chemical process and the resulting grain and texture add a unique aesthetic to each photograph, which many photographers find captivating. Furthermore, the tactile nature of loading film, advancing the roll, and waiting for the results creates a sense of ritual and connection to the physical process of photography.\n\n**Conclusion (approx. 100 words)**\n\nIn conclusion, the inclination towards film photography in an era dominated by digital cameras and mobile phones is a testament to the enduring appeal of a more deliberate and creative process. Despite the convenience and superior results of digital technology, film photography offers a unique aesthetic, tactile experience, and sense of accomplishment that is difficult to replicate.

Begin with a general overview, followed by specific steps or components of the algorithm, concluding with its application on such images.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint#\nStable Diffusion is a generative model that uses a hierarchical structure to improve the quality of images with low resolution and poor quality. Here's a general overview and breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n**Overview:**\nStable Diffusion is a generative model that uses a hierarchical structure to progressively refine an image from a low-resolution, noisy input to a high-quality output. The model consists of multiple stages, each refining the previous stage's output. This hierarchical structure allows the model to capture complex patterns and details in the input image, resulting in improved visual quality.\n\n**Components of the algorithm:**\n\n1. **Noise Schedule:** The algorithm starts with a noise schedule, which is a sequence of noise levels that the model uses to perturb the input image. The noise schedule is designed to gradually decrease the noise level as the model refines the image.\n2. **Diffusion Process:** The diffusion process is the core component of the algorithm. It consists of multiple stages, each applying a series of transformations to the input image. These transformations include:\n\t* **Diffusion Step:** A diffusion step applies a noise perturbation to the input image, which is then refined by a neural network.\n\t* **Denoising Step:** A denoising step applies a denoising filter to the output of the diffusion step, removing some of the added noise.\n3. **Neural Network:** The neural network is used to refine the output of each diffusion step. It takes the noisy input image and outputs a refined version of the image.\n4. **Hierarchical Structure:** The algorithm uses a hierarchical structure, where each stage refines the output of the previous stage. This allows the model to capture complex patterns and details in the input image.\n\n**Application to low-resolution and poor-quality images:**\n\nTo apply Stable Diffusion to low-resolution and poor-quality images, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Preprocessing:** Preprocess the input image by resizing it to a lower resolution (e.g., 256x256) and applying a noise schedule to simulate the degradation of the image.\n2. **Initialization:** Initialize the diffusion process by setting the input image as the starting point.\n3. **Diffusion Steps:** Apply multiple diffusion steps, each refining the output of the previous step. Each diffusion step consists of a diffusion step and a denoising step.\n4. **Neural Network:** Use the neural network to refine the output of each diffusion step.\n5. **Hierarchical Refining:** Refine the output of each stage by applying the diffusion process again, using the output of the previous stage as input.\n6. **Final Output:** The final output is the refined image, which should have improved visual quality compared to the input image.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose we have a low-resolution image of a cat with poor quality (e.g., 128x128 pixels, noisy and blurry). We can apply the Stable Diffusion algorithm as follows:\n\n1. Preprocessing: Resize the image to 256x256 pixels and apply a noise schedule to simulate degradation.\n2. Initialization: Set the input image as the starting point.\n3. Diffusion Steps: Apply 5 diffusion steps, each refining the output of the previous step.\n4. Neural Network: Use a neural network to refine the output of each diffusion step.\n5. Hierarchical Refining: Refine the output of each stage by applying the diffusion process again, using the output of the previous stage as input.\n6. Final Output: The final output is a refined image of the cat with improved visual quality (e.g., 512x512 pixels, sharp and clear).\n\nBy using a hierarchical structure and multiple diffusion steps, Stable Diffusion can effectively improve the visual quality of low-resolution and poor-quality images.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify the 1 added constraint.\n2) Please descriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# satisfies the 1 added constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 1 element ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies the 1 added constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 1 added constraint is to use a hierarchical structure in the explanation of the stable diffusion algorithm.\n\n2) The #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# does satisfy the 1 added constraint as it explicitly describes the hierarchical structure of the algorithm and how it progressively refines the image through multiple stages.\n\n3) ['YES']"}}]}

For each tier, confine your explanation to a paragraph not exceeding 200 words.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 3 constraints#\n**Summary**\nThe stable diffusion algorithm is a hierarchical method that improves the aesthetic quality of low-resolution, poor-quality AI-generated images by iteratively refining the image through a series of transformations. This process is achieved by employing a hierarchical structure, where each level refines the previous one, resulting in a more detailed and realistic image.\n\n**Level 1: Hierarchical Structure**\nThe algorithm begins with a hierarchical structure, comprising multiple stages, each representing a different level of refinement. This structure allows for a gradual and controlled refinement of the image, enabling the algorithm to focus on specific aspects of the image at each stage.\n\n**Level 2: Diffusion Process**\nThe algorithm employs a diffusion process, where the image is transformed through a series of iterations, with each iteration refining the previous one. This process is based on the concept of diffusion, where the algorithm iteratively refines the image by applying a series of transformations, such as blurring, sharpening, and noise reduction.\n\n**Level 3: Noise Reduction**\nThe first stage of the diffusion process focuses on reducing noise in the image. This is achieved by applying a Gaussian filter, which smoothes the image, reducing the visibility of noise and artifacts. This step helps to create a more stable foundation for the subsequent refinement stages.\n\n**Level 4: Detail Enhancement**\nThe next stage enhances the details in the image. This is achieved by applying a sharpening filter, which amplifies the high-frequency components of the image, resulting in a more detailed and textured appearance.\n\n**Level 5: Color Correction**\nThe algorithm then corrects the color palette of the image, ensuring that the colors are accurate and consistent. This is achieved by applying a color correction filter, which adjusts the color values based on the image's color histogram.\n\n**Level 6: Final Refinement**\nThe final stage refines the image through a series of iterations, combining the previous stages' outputs. This ensures that the image is refined to the desired level of quality, with a focus on details, texture, and color accuracy.\n\n**Application**\nThe stable diffusion algorithm can be applied to low-resolution, poor-quality AI-generated images to improve their aesthetic quality. By iteratively refining the image through the hierarchical structure, the algorithm can enhance the details, texture, and color accuracy, resulting in a more realistic and visually appealing image.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 3 added constraints.\n2) For the 3 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 3 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 3 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 3 added constraints are:\n   - Maintain a hierarchical structure in the explanation, progressing from general to specific details, with each level distinctly labeled and ordered.\n   - Confine each tier's explanation to a paragraph not exceeding 200 words.\n   - Conclude with the application of the algorithm on low-resolution, poor-quality images.\n\n2) Evaluation of the constraints:\n   - The answer maintains a hierarchical structure, progressing from a summary to specific levels, with each level distinctly labeled and ordered. **(Satisfies the first constraint: YES)**\n   - Each tier's explanation is concise and does not exceed 200 words. **(Satisfies the second constraint: YES)**\n   - The application of the algorithm on low-resolution, poor-quality images is clearly stated at the end. **(Satisfies the third constraint: YES)**\n\n3) Final output:\n```python\n['YES', 'YES', 'YES']\n```"}}]}

This step is critical in removing unwanted artifacts and enhancing the overall image quality.\n\n**Level 4: Refinement**\n\nThe denoised image is then refined using a series of iterative refinement steps, each applying a specific transformation to the image.

Firstly, it leverages a generative model to produce an initial image. This model is trained on a vast dataset of high-quality images, allowing it to learn the patterns and structures of natural scenes. Subsequently, the algorithm refines the generated image through a series of iterative processes.\n\n**Tier 2: Denoising and Refining**\n\nIn addition, the algorithm employs a denoising process to reduce the noise and artifacts present in the initial image. This is achieved through a series of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that progressively refine the image. Furthermore, the algorithm incorporates a spatial attention mechanism to focus on specific regions of the image, allowing for more accurate refinement. Consequently, the denoised image is more coherent and visually appealing.\n\n**Tier 3: Detail Enhancement**\n\nMoreover, the algorithm employs a detail enhancement module to add finer details to the refined image. This module utilizes a combination of frequency analysis and spatial filtering techniques to identify and amplify subtle patterns and textures. Additionally, the module incorporates a color correction mechanism to ensure accurate color representation. Ultimately, the enhanced image exhibits a level of detail and realism that is comparable to high-quality photographs.\n\n**Tier 4: Final Refining and Post-processing**\n\nLastly, the algorithm applies a series of post-processing techniques to further refine the enhanced image. Firstly, it applies a contrast adjustment to optimize the image's dynamic range. Secondly, it applies a color grading algorithm to enhance the image's color palette. Finally, the algorithm applies a noise reduction technique to eliminate any remaining artifacts. The resulting image is a high-quality, visually appealing representation of the original low-resolution AI-synthesized image.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 5 added constraints.\n2) For the 5 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 5 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 5 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 5 added constraints are:\n   - Each tier must be distinctly labeled and ordered.\n   - Each tier must contain a paragraph not exceeding 200 words.\n   - Each sentence must not exceed 20 words.\n   - Each sentence must commence with a transitional word or phrase.\n   - The explanation must follow a hierarchical structure, transitioning from broad concepts to finer details.\n\n2) Discrimination of whether the answer satisfies each constraint:\n   - The answer satisfies the constraint of distinct labeling and ordering of each tier (YES).\n   - Each tier contains paragraphs that do not exceed 200 words (YES).\n   - Each sentence does not exceed 20 words (YES).\n   - Each sentence commences with a transitional word or phrase (YES).\n   - The explanation follows a hierarchical structure, transitioning from broad concepts to finer details (YES).\n\n3) Final output:\n```python\n['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']\n```"}}]}

Please respond in a hierarchical list format, detailing steps or considerations at each level of the hierarchy.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint#\nTeaching your cat French! While cats are known for their independence and stubbornness, with patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement, you can teach your feline friend some basic French phrases. Here's a hierarchical list of steps to help you get started:\n\n**Level 1: Preparation**\n\n1.1. **Choose the right time**: Cats are most receptive to learning when they're feeling relaxed and focused. Try to teach your cat during periods of calm, such as after a meal or a play session.\n\n1.2. **Use positive reinforcement**: Reward your cat with treats, praise, and affection when they respond correctly. This positive reinforcement will encourage them to associate learning with good outcomes.\n\n1.3. **Start with simple phrases**: Begin with short, simple phrases that your cat can easily learn and remember. Focus on phrases that are relevant to their daily life, such as \"Bon app\u00e9tit\" (good eating) or \"Dormez bien\" (sleep well).\n\n**Level 2: Basic Phrases**\n\n2.1. **Introduce the sound of the language**: Start by exposing your cat to the sounds and rhythms of the French language. Play French music, watch French movies, or listen to French audiobooks.\n\n2.2. **Teach individual words**: Break down phrases into individual words and teach them separately. Use flashcards or written words to help your cat associate the written word with the spoken word.\n\n2.3. **Use visual aids**: Cats are visual animals, so use pictures or objects to help your cat associate the words with meanings. For example, show your cat a picture of a bowl of food and say \"Bon app\u00e9tit.\"\n\n**Level 3: Sentence Structure**\n\n3.1. **Introduce sentence structure**: Once your cat is familiar with individual words, introduce simple sentence structures. Start with short sentences like \"Bonjour, mon chat\" (hello, my cat) or \"Je t'aime\" (I love you).\n\n3.2. **Practice, practice, practice**: Repeat the sentences multiple times, using the same tone and inflection each time. Encourage your cat to repeat the phrases by responding with the correct pronunciation.\n\n**Level 4: Advanced Phrases**\n\n4.1. **Build upon basic phrases**: Once your cat has mastered basic phrases, introduce more complex sentences and phrases. For example, \"Je veux manger\" (I want to eat) or \"Je veux jouer\" (I want to play).\n\n4.2. **Use context**: Teach your cat to use phrases in context. For example, say \"Bonjour, mon chat\" when you enter the room, and \"Je veux manger\" when you're preparing their food.\n\n**Level 5: Reinforcement and Maintenance**\n\n5.1. **Reinforce learning**: Continue to reward your cat for correct responses and reinforce what they've learned.\n\n5.2. **Maintain consistency**: Use the same phrases and tone consistently to avoid confusing your cat.\n\n5.3. **Be patient**: Learning a new language takes time, so be patient with your cat and don't get discouraged if they don't pick up a phrase immediately.\n\nRemember, every cat is different, and some may learn faster than others. With patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement, you can teach your cat some basic French phrases and strengthen your bond with them.

Please ensure each step or consideration is succinctly expressed in one sentence.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 2 constraints#\nTeaching your cat French! While cats are not naturally inclined to learn human languages like humans, you can still teach them to associate certain words and phrases with meanings and actions. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n**Basic Level: Association and Conditioning**\n\n1. Start with simple words and phrases, such as \"bonjour\" (hello), \"salut\" (hi), and \"manger\" (eat).\n2. Use positive reinforcement techniques, like treats and praise, to associate the words with the desired actions or objects.\n3. Repeat the words and phrases frequently, so your cat becomes familiar with the sounds and meanings.\n\n**Intermediate Level: Visual Cues and Gestures**\n\n4. Use visual cues, such as hand gestures or props, to help your cat associate the words with the actions or objects.\n5. For example, hold a treat in your hand and say \"manger\" while making a eating motion with your other hand.\n6. Encourage your cat to mimic the action by offering the treat and rewarding them when they perform the desired behavior.\n\n**Advanced Level: Vocalizations and Contextualization**\n\n7. Gradually introduce more complex words and phrases, such as \"dormir\" (sleep) and \"aller\" (go).\n8. Use contextual cues, such as setting up a sleeping area and saying \"dormir\" while your cat approaches the area.\n9. Encourage your cat to respond to the words by calling them to the sleeping area and rewarding them when they settle down.\n\n**Expert Level: Sentence Structure and Conversational Flow**\n\n10. Introduce sentence structures, such as \"Va manger, mon amour\" (Go eat, my love), to encourage your cat to respond to more complex commands.\n11. Practice conversational flow by using a mix of short and long sentences, and encouraging your cat to respond with their own vocalizations.\n12. Be patient and consistent, as cats may not always respond immediately or accurately.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n13. Keep training sessions short and fun to maintain your cat's attention and interest.\n14. Be prepared for individual differences, as some cats may learn faster or slower than others.\n15. Use a calm and gentle tone of voice, as loud or harsh sounds can startle or scare your cat.\n16. Consider using a cat-friendly language learning app or online resource to supplement your training and provide additional support.\n\nRemember, teaching your cat French is a fun and rewarding experience, but it's essential to be patient, consistent, and understanding of your cat's unique learning style and abilities.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 2 added constraints.\n2) For the 2 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 2 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 2 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 2 added constraints are:\n   - Respond in a hierarchical list format, detailing steps or considerations at each level of the hierarchy.\n   - Ensure each step or consideration is succinctly expressed in one sentence.\n\n2) \n   - The first constraint is satisfied as the answer is presented in a hierarchical list format with clear levels (Basic Level, Intermediate Level, Advanced Level, Expert Level, Additional Considerations).\n   - The second constraint is also satisfied as each step or consideration is expressed in one succinct sentence.\n\n3) ['YES', 'YES']"}}]}

Reflection of Sunlight** | The moon reflects the sunlight that hits its surface. Even when the moon is in the sky during the day, it is still reflecting some of the sun's light, making it visible to the naked eye. The reflected light is often fainter than the bright sunlight, but it's still enough to make the moon visible. |\n| **2. Angular Separation** | The moon's orbit is tilted at an angle of about 5 degrees with respect to the Earth's orbit around the sun. This means that the moon can be above the horizon during the day, even when the sun is above the horizon, as long as it's not directly in the sun's shadow. The angular separation between the sun and the moon allows us to see the moon during the day. |\n| **3. Atmospheric Scattering** | The Earth's atmosphere scatters shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, more than longer wavelengths, such as red and orange. This is known as Rayleigh scattering. During the day, the atmosphere scatters some of the sun's light, making it appear more diffuse and less intense. The moon, being much fainter than the sun, is less affected by this scattering, making it more visible in the bright daytime sky. |\n\nI hope this helps!

He was the first African American to serve on the United States Supreme Court, and he played a crucial role in many landmark cases related to civil rights and racial equality.\n\nMarshall was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967 and served for 24 years, until his retirement in 1991. During his tenure, he wrote the majority opinion in several influential cases, including \\textit{Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education} (1971), which upheld the use of busing to desegregate schools, and \\textit{Washington v. Davis} (1976), which established the \"intent\" test for determining whether a law or policy is discriminatory.\n\nMarshall's legacy extends beyond his work on the Supreme Court. He was a pioneering civil rights lawyer who argued several landmark cases before the Court, including \\textit{Brown v. Board of Education} (1954), which declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional. He was also a key figure in the NAACP, serving as its chief counsel from 1940 to 1961 and playing a leading role in the organization's efforts to challenge segregation and discrimination.\n\nMarshall's contributions to the Civil Rights Movement are immeasurable, and he remains an important figure in American legal and social history.\n\n\\end{document}\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify the 1 added constraint.\n2) Please descriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# satisfies the 1 added constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 1 element ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies the 1 added constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 1 added constraint is that the response should be in LaTeX format.\n\n2) The #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# is indeed formatted in LaTeX, as it includes the necessary LaTeX document structure and commands.\n\n3) ['YES']"}}]}
