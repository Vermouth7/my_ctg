He had a way of living life on his own terms, never one to be tied down by the conventions of society. His hair was a wild tangle of brown locks, his eyes a piercing blue that seemed to hold a thousand stories. His features were chiseled, as if carved from the rugged landscape of the mountains he loved to hike.\n\nBut despite his rugged exterior, there was a depth to him, a sense of vulnerability that he only revealed to those closest to him. He had a way of carrying himself with a quiet confidence, as if he knew that he was capable of overcoming any obstacle that came his way.\n\nIt was this confidence that had led him to make some questionable decisions in the past, decisions that had left him lost and alone in the wilderness of his own making. But he had always been one to learn from his mistakes, to use them as opportunities to grow and become a better version of himself.\n\nAnd so, when he stumbled upon a lost bottle of vodka in the woods, he knew that it was a sign, a sign that it was time to confront the demons that had been haunting him for so long. He drank to forget, to drown out the voices in his head that told him he was a failure, that he was unworthy of love.\n\nAs the liquor coursed through his veins, he felt a sense of freedom wash over him, a sense of release from the burdens that had been weighing him down. He laughed, a deep, throaty laugh that echoed through the trees, as he realized that he was not alone, that he was part of something much larger than himself.\n\nAnd so, he continued to drink, to lose himself in the haze of the vodka, to forget the pain and the heartache that had left him feeling lost and alone. For in the end, it was not the vodka that had found him, but he who had found the vodka, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope, always a chance to start anew.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify the 1 added constraint.\n2) Please descriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# satisfies the 1 added constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 1 element ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies the 1 added constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 1 added constraint is: \"write a story that describes a man.\"\n\n2) The #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# does satisfy the 1 added constraint, as it provides a detailed description of a man, including his physical appearance, personality traits, and emotional struggles.\n\n3) ['YES']"}}]}
