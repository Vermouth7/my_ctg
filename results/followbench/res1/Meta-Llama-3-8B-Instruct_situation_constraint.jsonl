You carried both books to the dining room and set down the black notebook on the table.\n6. You placed the red book inside a drawer of a nearby cabinet.\n\nNow, let's analyze what's happened to the golden key:\n\n1. You placed it in a blue envelope.\n2. The blue envelope was placed inside the red book.\n3. The red book was moved to the library room.\n4. The blue envelope was removed from the red book and placed in the black notebook.\n5. The black notebook was set down on the dining room table.\n6. The red book was placed in a drawer of a nearby cabinet.\n\nSo, the golden key is still inside the blue envelope, which is currently inside the black notebook on the dining room table."}
{"prompt_new": "Imagine the following scenario:\n\nYou are in your bedroom. On your desk, there's a golden key. You take the key and place it inside a blue envelope. You then place this envelope inside a red book titled \"Mysteries of the Universe\". Closing the book, you carry it to the library room. In the library, you place the red book on a wooden shelf next to a green plant. You then decide to grab a black notebook from the adjacent shelf. As you pick it up, you slip the blue envelope from the red book into the black notebook. Carrying both books, you proceed to the dining room. On the dining table, you set down the black notebook but decide to place the red book inside a drawer of a nearby cabinet. After a few minutes, you pick up the black notebook and walk to the study.\n\nGiven the actions taken, where is the golden key at the end of this scenario?", "result": "I love a good puzzle!\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. You take the golden key, put it in a blue envelope, and put the envelope in the red book \"Mysteries of the Universe\".\n2. You place the red book on a shelf in the library room.\n3. You take the blue envelope out of the red book and put it in the black notebook.\n4. You place the black notebook on the dining table, but then move the red book to a drawer in a cabinet.\n5. You pick up the black notebook and take it to the study.\n\nNow, let's think about where the blue envelope might be. Since you took the blue envelope out of the red book and put it in the black notebook, and you still have the black notebook with you, the blue envelope must be inside the black notebook.\n\nAnd since you didn't put the golden key anywhere else, it must still be inside the blue envelope, which is inside the black notebook.\n\nSo, at the end of this scenario, the golden key is inside the black notebook."}

Returns a message with the new balance.\n* `withdraw`: Withdraws a positive amount from the account, as long as the amount does not exceed the current balance. Returns a message with the new balance.\n* `get_balance`: Returns the account's balance.\n\nThe `SavingsAccount` class inherits from `BankAccount` and adds the following method:\n\n* `apply_interest`: Calculates and adds interest to the account balance based on the provided interest rate. Returns a message with the new balance.\n\nYou can use these classes as follows:\n```\naccount = BankAccount(12345, 1000)\nprint(account.deposit(500))  # Output: Deposited 500 into account 12345. New balance: 1500\nprint(account.withdraw(200))  # Output: Withdrew 200 from account 12345. New balance: 1300\nprint(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1300\n\nsavings_account = SavingsAccount(67890, 2000, 0.03)\nprint(savings_account.apply_interest())  # Output: Applied interest of 60.00 to account 67890. New balance: 2060.00\nprint(savings_account.get_balance())  # Output: 2060.0\n```\nNote that the `SavingsAccount` class uses the `super().__init__` method to call the `__init__` method of the `BankAccount` class, which initializes the account number and balance. The `apply_interest` method calculates the interest using the interest rate and adds it to the balance."}
