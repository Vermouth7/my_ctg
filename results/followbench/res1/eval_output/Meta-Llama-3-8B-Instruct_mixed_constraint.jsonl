Let's join art historian Elizabeth Lev on a journey along the ceiling paintings of the famous building and Michelangelo's vivid depiction of traditional stories. As we explore, we'll discover how the artist went beyond the religious iconography of his time to create something new and innovative. 500 years after the artwork's creation, we're invited to take a fresh look at the Sistine Chapel as if it were a mirror, and ask ourselves, \"Who am I and what role do I play in this grand drama of life?\" Let's take a step into this magnificent work of art and explore its secrets together!\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 2 added constraints.\n2) For the 2 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 2 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 2 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 2 added constraints are:\n   - Use a friendly and inviting tone.\n   - There should be 5 sentences in the translated text.\n\n2) Discrimination of constraints:\n   - The answer satisfies the first constraint (friendly and inviting tone) as it uses welcoming language and encourages exploration.\n   - The answer satisfies the second constraint as it consists of 5 sentences.\n\n3) ['YES', 'YES']"}}]}
