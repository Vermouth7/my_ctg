But for John, the beauty of the evening was lost on him. He was too consumed by his own thoughts, his mind racing with the memories of the past.\n\nHe had been wandering the streets for hours, trying to clear his head, but nothing seemed to be working. The vodka he had found in the alleyway had initially brought him some relief, but now it was starting to wear off, leaving him feeling empty and hollow.\n\nAs he walked, he stumbled upon a small park, and without thinking, he collapsed onto a bench. The cool night air enveloped him, and for a moment, he felt a sense of peace. But it was short-lived, as the memories came flooding back, and he let out a deep sigh.\n\nHe thought about his wife, Sarah, and the way she used to make him laugh. He thought about their life together, the good times and the bad. He thought about the way she left him, without explanation, without a goodbye.\n\nJohn's eyes welled up with tears as he remembered the way she used to hold his hand, the way she used to look at him with love in her eyes. He felt a pang of regret for the way he had treated her, for the way he had taken her for granted.\n\nAs the tears streamed down his face, John realized that he had been running from his emotions for too long. He had been trying to forget, to drown his sorrows in the vodka, but it wasn't working. He needed to face the pain head-on, to confront the demons that had been haunting him for so long.\n\nWith a newfound sense of determination, John stood up from the bench, wiped away his tears, and began to walk back to his apartment. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but he was ready to start the process of healing, to start the process of forgetting."}

{"prompt_new": "Summarize the below text using one sentence.\n\nWe analyze the storage and recall of factual associations in autoregressive transformer language models, finding evidence that these associations correspond to localized, directly-editable computations.

This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME).

To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another.
