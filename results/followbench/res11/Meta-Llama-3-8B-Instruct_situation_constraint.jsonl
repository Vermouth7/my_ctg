Here's a Python function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\ndef unique(l: list, n: int):\n    count_dict = {}\n    for i in l:\n        if i in count_dict:\n            count_dict[i] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[i] = 1\n    return sorted([i for i, j in count_dict.items() if j == n])\n```\n\nLet's break down how this function works:\n\n1. We create an empty dictionary `count_dict` to store the count of each element in the list.\n2. We iterate over the list `l` and for each element, we check if it's already in the dictionary. If it is, we increment its count by 1. If not, we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n3. We use a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the elements from the dictionary that have a count equal to `n`. We use the dictionary's `.items()` method to get a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the key (the element) and its value (the count). We then use a conditional statement to filter out the elements that don't have a count of `n`.\n4. Finally, we return the sorted list of unique elements that appear exactly `n` times in the original list.\n\nLet's test the function with the example you provided:\n\n```python\nprint(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1))  # [0, 2, 9, 123]\n```\n\nThe output is as expected!"}

The constructor initializes the number of rows and columns, and then resizes the `matrixData` vector to the correct size.\n\nThe `getValue` method returns the value at a specific position in the matrix, and the `setValue` method sets the value at a specific position in the matrix.

This operator is overloaded for both non-const and const objects. In the non-const version, the operator returns a reference to the element, allowing it to be modified. In the const version, the operator returns a const reference to the element, preventing modification.\n\nInside the `operator()`, it checks if the indices are within the bounds of the matrix. If they are not, it throws an `std::out_of_range` exception. If the indices are valid, it returns a reference to the corresponding element in the `data` vector.\n\nYou can use the `Matrix` class as follows:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    Matrix m(3, 4);\n\n    // Access and modify an element\n    m(1, 2) = 10;\n\n    // Access a const element\n    int value = m(1, 2);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a `Matrix` object `m` is created with 3 rows and 4 columns. The element at row 1 and column 2 is accessed and modified using the `operator()`. Then, the same element is accessed and read using the `operator()` again, this time as a const object."}
