We create an empty dictionary `count_dict` to store the count of each element in the list.\n2. We iterate over the list `l` and for each element, we check if it's already in the dictionary. If it is, we increment its count by 1. If not, we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n3. We use a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the elements from the dictionary that have a count equal to `n`. We use the dictionary's `.items()` method to get a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the key (the element) and its value (the count). We then use a conditional statement to filter out the elements that don't have a count of `n`.\n4. Finally, we return the sorted list of unique elements that appear exactly `n` times in the original list.\n\nLet's test the function with the example you provided:\n\n```python\nprint(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1))  # [0, 2, 9, 123]\n```\n\nThe output is as expected!\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 2 added constraints.\n2) For the 2 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 2 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 2 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 2 added constraints are:\n   - The function should return a list with elements that appear exactly `n` times in the given list.\n   - The returned list should be sorted in ascending order.\n\n2) Discrimination of whether the answer satisfies each constraint:\n   - The first constraint is satisfied because the function filters elements based on their count, returning only those that appear exactly `n` times.\n   - The second constraint is satisfied because the function uses the `sorted()` function to ensure the returned list is in ascending order.\n\n3) Final output:\n```python\n['YES', 'YES']\n```"}}]}

Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 5 constraints#\nAs a software engineer at a fast-paced tech startup, effective time management is crucial to meet project deadlines, prioritize tasks, and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Considering your recent transition from an internship to a full-time role and the multiple projects you've taken on, here are some tips to help you improve your time management skills:\n\n1. **Set clear goals and priorities**: Establish clear goals and priorities for each project, and break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. This will help you focus on the most important tasks and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n2. **Use a task management tool**: Utilize a task management tool like Trello, Asana, or Jira to organize and prioritize your tasks. These tools allow you to create boards, lists, and cards to visualize your work, set deadlines, and assign tasks to team members.\n3. **Create a schedule**: Plan out your day, week, or month in advance. Set specific times for work, breaks, and personal activities. Sticking to a schedule will help you stay on track and avoid procrastination.\n4. **Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix**: Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks into four quadrants: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and not urgent or important. Focus on the most critical tasks first, and delegate or defer less important tasks when possible.\n5. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**: Work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This technique can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n6. **Learn to say no**: Be mindful of taking on too much at once. Learn to say no to tasks that are not aligned with your priorities or that you cannot realistically complete. Remember, saying no to something that doesn't align with your goals means saying yes to something that does.\n7. **Communicate with your team and manager**: Keep your team and manager informed about your progress, challenges, and any changes to your schedule. This will help you avoid misunderstandings and ensure everyone is on the same page.\n8. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your time management strategy and adjust as needed. Identify what's working and what's not, and make changes to optimize your workflow.\n9. **Take breaks and practice self-care**: Don't forget to take breaks and prioritize self-care. Taking short breaks can help you recharge and maintain productivity, while neglecting self-care can lead to burnout.\n10. **Seek feedback and support**: Ask for feedback from your colleagues, manager, or mentor on your time management skills. They may have valuable insights or suggestions to help you improve.\n\nTo specifically address your scenario, consider the following:\n\n* As you start your new job, take some time to learn the company's workflow, processes, and tools. This will help you understand what's expected of you and how to manage your time effectively.\n* Prioritize your tasks based on the company's goals and objectives, as well as your own career goals.\n* Don't be afraid to ask for help or guidance from your colleagues or manager if you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to manage your time.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you'll be better equipped to manage your time effectively, prioritize tasks, and achieve your goals as a software engineer at your new company.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 5 added constraints.\n2) For the 5 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 5 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 5 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 5 added constraints are:\n   - After transitioning from an internship to a full-time role\n   - I've taken on multiple projects\n   - I've just been hired as a software engineer\n   - I am starting the new job next week\n   - I am at a fast-paced tech startup\n\n2) Discrimination of whether the answer satisfies each constraint:\n   - Constraint 1: \"After transitioning from an internship to a full-time role\" - YES\n   - Constraint 2: \"I've taken on multiple projects\" - YES\n   - Constraint 3: \"I've just been hired as a software engineer\" - YES\n   - Constraint 4: \"I am starting the new job next week\" - YES\n   - Constraint 5: \"I am at a fast-paced tech startup\" - YES\n\n3) Final output:\n```python\n['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']\n```"}}]}

Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 3 constraints#\nI'd be happy to help you wrap your gift beautifully!\n\nTo make your gift look attractive and thoughtful, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose a suitable wrapping paper**: Select a wrapping paper that complements the book's cover and your friend's personal style. You can opt for a neutral color like brown, beige, or gray, or something more vibrant if your friend has a bold personality. Make sure the paper is sturdy enough to hold the book securely.\n2. **Measure the book**: Measure the book's dimensions to ensure you have enough wrapping paper. You can use a wrapping paper with a grid pattern to help you cut the paper accurately.\n3. **Cut the wrapping paper**: Cut a piece of wrapping paper slightly larger than the book. Leave a 1-2 inch margin around the book to fold the paper over and create a neat seam.\n4. **Create a clean surface**: Place the book on a flat surface, and smooth out any wrinkles or creases in the wrapping paper.\n5. **Position the book**: Place the book in the center of the wrapping paper, ensuring it's aligned with the edges of the paper.\n6. **Fold and crease the paper**: Fold one edge of the paper over the book and crease it with your finger or a bone folder. Repeat this process for the other edges, making sure to crease each fold carefully.\n7. **Tuck and fold the corners**: Tuck the corners of the paper under the book, making sure they're flush with the edges. Fold the corners inward to create a neat, crisp fold.\n8. **Secure with tape**: Apply a small piece of tape to the seam where the paper overlaps, making sure it's not visible from the outside. You can also use a wrapping paper tape or a decorative tape to add a pop of color.\n9. **Add a gift tag or card**: Attach a gift tag or a card with a personal message to the wrapping paper. This adds a thoughtful touch and makes the gift even more special.\n10. **Finishing touches**: Fluff out any wrinkles or creases, and your gift is ready to be presented!\n\nTips to make it extra special:\n\n* Use a ribbon or twine to add a decorative touch to the gift.\n* Add some decorative elements like stickers, washi tape, or a small gift embellishment to give it a personal touch.\n* Consider using a gift box or a gift bag if the book is large or irregularly shaped.\n* Make sure to wrap the gift carefully and neatly, as a well-wrapped gift can make a big difference in the overall presentation.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create a beautifully wrapped gift that will make your friend feel special on their birthday.

Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Initial Instruction + 5 constraints#\nI'm attending a \"Literature and Classics\" themed surprise birthday party for a close friend this weekend, and I've selected a book that aligns perfectly with the theme. Can you guide me on how to wrap the present neatly to ensure it looks both attractive and thoughtful? Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 5 constraints#\nWhat a wonderful gesture! I'd be delighted to help you wrap the book in a way that's both attractive and thoughtful. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create a beautiful and literary-inspired gift wrapping:\n\nMaterials needed:\n\n* The book (of course!)\n* Gift wrapping paper (choose a design that complements the literary theme)\n* Gift wrapping tape\n* Ribbon or twine (optional)\n* Decorative elements (optional, e.g., book-themed stickers, book marks, or a small bookmark)\n\nStep 1: Choose the right wrapping paper\nSelect a wrapping paper that complements the literary theme. You can opt for a paper with a book-inspired design, such as a pattern of book spines, book covers, or even a quote from a famous author. If you can't find a book-themed paper, a neutral color like brown, beige, or gray can work well.\n\nStep 2: Measure the book\nMeasure the book's dimensions to ensure you have enough wrapping paper. Leave a little extra paper around the edges to tuck in as you wrap.\n\nStep 3: Place the book on the wrapping paper\nPosition the book in the center of the wrapping paper, ensuring it's aligned with the edges of the paper. You can use a ruler or a straightedge to help you get a straight line.\n\nStep 4: Fold and crease the paper\nFold one edge of the paper over the book and crease it with your finger or a bone folder. Repeat this process with the other edges, making sure to crease each fold carefully.\n\nStep 5: Tuck and fold the edges\nTuck the edges of the paper under the book, making sure they're even and symmetrical. Fold the edges inward to create a neat and tidy finish.\n\nStep 6: Add a ribbon or twine\nIf you'd like to add a touch of elegance, tie a ribbon or twine around the book. You can choose a ribbon that matches the color of the wrapping paper or opt for a contrasting color to add a pop of color.\n\nStep 7: Add decorative elements (optional)\nIf you'd like to add a personal touch, consider attaching a small bookmark, a book-themed sticker, or a handwritten note to the wrapping paper. You could also include a small gift, like a bookmark or a book light, to make the gift even more special.\n\nStep 8: Finish with a flourish\nOnce you've added any decorative elements, tie the ribbon or twine in a bow and fluff out the wrapping paper to create a neat and attractive package.\n\nTips and Variations:\n\n* Consider adding a small gift card or a bookplate with a personal message to make the gift even more special.\n* If you're feeling crafty, you can create your own book-themed wrapping paper by printing out a design or using a book cover as a wrapping paper.\n* To add an extra layer of protection, you can wrap the book in a paper bag or a cloth pouch before wrapping it in the decorative paper.\n* If you're short on time, you can use a gift bag or a gift box instead of wrapping the book in paper.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create a beautiful and thoughtful gift that your friend will appreciate.

If they are not, it throws an `std::out_of_range` exception. If the indices are valid, it returns a reference to the corresponding element in the `data` vector.\n\nYou can use the `Matrix` class as follows:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    Matrix m(3, 4);\n\n    // Access and modify an element\n    m(1, 2) = 10;\n\n    // Access a const element\n    int value = m(1, 2);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a `Matrix` object `m` is created with 3 rows and 4 columns. The element at row 1 and column 2 is accessed and modified using the `operator()`. Then, the same element is accessed and read using the `operator()` again, this time as a const object.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 3 added constraints.\n2) For the 3 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 3 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 3 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 3 added constraints are:\n   - The class should have a constructor that takes the number of rows and columns as arguments and initializes the matrix with zeros.\n   - Implement the operator() method that allows access to individual elements of the matrix using the row and column indices.
