How much did she earn in total?", "result": "I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nOn Friday, Weng babysat for 50 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.83 hours (50 minutes / 60 = 0.83). Since it's a workday, she earns $12 per hour, so:\n\n0.83 hours x $12 per hour = $10.96\n\nOn Saturday morning, Weng babysat for 1.5 hours, which is equivalent to:\n\n1.5 hours x $16 per hour = $24\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, she babysat for 30 minutes, which is equivalent to:\n\n0.5 hours x $16 per hour = $8\n\nAdding up her earnings from Friday and Saturday:\n\n$10.96 + $24 + $8 = $43.96\n\nHowever, she had to compensate her employer $5 for breaking the cup, so we subtract that from her total earnings:\n\n$43.96 - $5 = $38.96\n\nWeng earned a total of $38.96."}

Then, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the elements that appear once in the original list. Finally, it sorts this list in ascending order and returns it.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```python\nprint(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output: [0, 2, 9, 123]\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the input list contains hashable elements (i.e., elements that can be used as dictionary keys).

The `set` function is used to remove duplicates from the resulting list.\n\nThe function then sorts the resulting list in ascending order using the `sorted` function.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```python\nprint(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1))  # Output: [0, 2, 9, 123]\n```"}

Given your recent transition from an internship to a full-time role and taking on multiple projects, here are some tips to help you improve your time management skills:\n\n1. **Set clear goals and priorities**: As you start your new role, discuss your priorities with your manager and set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. This will help you focus on the most critical tasks and allocate your time effectively.\n2. **Use a task management tool**: Familiarize yourself with tools like Trello, Asana, or Jira to organize and prioritize your tasks. These tools allow you to categorize, assign, and track tasks, making it easier to stay on top of your work.\n3. **Create a schedule**: Plan out your day, week, or month in advance. Set specific time slots for tasks, meetings, and breaks. Be realistic about how much time each task requires, and leave some buffer time for unexpected tasks or emergencies.\n4. **Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix**: Divide your tasks into four quadrants:\n\t* Urgent and important (Do First)\n\t* Important but not urgent (Schedule)\n\t* Urgent but not important (Delegate)\n\t* Not urgent or important (Eliminate)\n5. **Break tasks into smaller chunks**: Large projects can be overwhelming. Break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. This will help you make progress, stay focused, and avoid procrastination.\n6. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**: Work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). This technique can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n7. **Learn to say no**: Be mindful of taking on too much at once. Politely decline tasks that are not aligned with your priorities or that you cannot realistically complete. Communicate with your team and manager to negotiate or delegate tasks when necessary.\n8. **Stay organized**: Keep your digital and physical workspace organized. This includes your computer files, email inbox, and physical notes. A cluttered workspace can lead to wasted time searching for information and decreased productivity.\n9. **Take care of yourself**: Don't forget to prioritize self-care. Get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and take breaks to recharge. A healthy body and mind are essential for maintaining focus and productivity.\n10. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your time management strategy and adjust as needed. Identify what works for you and what doesn't, and make changes to optimize your workflow.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you'll be better equipped to manage your time effectively, prioritize your tasks, and deliver high-quality work as a software engineer at your new startup. Good luck in your new role!"}

The `Matrix` class has three member variables: `rows`, `cols`, and `data`. The `rows` and `cols` variables store the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively. The `data` variable is a 1D vector that stores the matrix elements.\n2.  The constructor `Matrix(int rows, int cols)` initializes the `rows`, `cols`, and `data` variables. It resizes the `data` vector to the correct size and initializes all elements to 0.\n3.  The `operator()` method allows accessing individual elements of the matrix using the row and column indices. It performs bounds checking and throws an `std::out_of_range` exception if the indices are out of bounds.\n4.  The `operator+` method performs matrix addition. It takes another `Matrix` as an argument and returns a new `Matrix` with the sum of the two matrices. If the dimensions of the matrices do not match, it throws an `std::invalid_argument` exception.\n\nYou can use this class to create and manipulate matrices in your C++ program. For example:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    Matrix m1(2, 3);\n    Matrix m2(2, 3);\n\n    m1(0, 0) = 1;\n    m1(0, 1) = 2;\n    m1(0, 2) = 3;\n    m1(1, 0) = 4;\n    m1(1, 1) = 5;\n    m1(1, 2) = 6;\n\n    m2(0, 0) = 7;\n    m2(0, 1) = 8;\n    m2(0, 2) = 9;\n    m2(1, 0) = 10;\n    m2(1, 1) = 11;\n    m2(1, 2) = 12;\n\n    Matrix result = m1 + m2;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {\n            std::cout << result(i, j) << \" \";\n        }\n        std::cout << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates two matrices `m1` and `m2`, adds them together using the `operator+` method, and prints the resulting matrix."}
