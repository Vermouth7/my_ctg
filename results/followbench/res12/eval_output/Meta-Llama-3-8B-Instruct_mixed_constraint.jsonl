It was his favorite brand, and he knew it would help him forget, if only for a little while.

The burn of the vodka coursed through his veins, and for a moment, he felt a sense of numbness wash over him. He took another swig, and another, until the bottle was almost empty.\n\nAs the vodka took hold, John's thoughts began to blur. He remembered the good times with her, the laughter, the adventures.

He collapsed onto a bench, the bottle still clutched in his hand. The vodka had worn off, and the pain was back, sharper than ever. He looked up at the stars, and for a moment, he felt like he was staring into the abyss.\n\nBut as he gazed up at the night sky, something shifted inside of him. He remembered the way she used to look at him, the way she used to make him feel like he was home. He remembered the good times, the laughter, the love.\n\nJohn got up from the bench, the bottle still clutched in his hand. He took one last swig, and then he threw the bottle away.
