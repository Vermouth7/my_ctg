You can use a piece of paper that's slightly larger than the book to create a neat and tidy wrap.\n3. **Cut the paper:** Cut the paper to the desired size, leaving a little extra on each side for folding and tucking.\n4. **Create a flat surface:** Place the book on a flat surface, and position the paper on top of it. Align the paper with the book's edges, making sure it's centered.\n5. **Fold and crease:** Fold one edge of the paper over the book and crease it with your finger or a bone folder. Repeat this process for the other edges, making sure to crease each fold carefully.\n6. **Tuck and fold:** Tuck the edges of the paper under the book, making sure they're even and symmetrical. Fold the paper over the edges to create a neat and tidy wrap.\n7. **Add a ribbon or bow:** Finish the gift by adding a ribbon or bow to the top of the book. This adds a touch of elegance and makes the gift look more thoughtful.\n\n**Additional Tips for a Surprise Party:**\n\n1. **Add a personal touch:** Consider adding a handwritten note or a small memento that relates to your friendship or the party theme.\n2. **Use a special wrapping technique:** Try a unique wrapping technique, such as a \"book wrap\" or a \" accordion fold,\" to make the gift stand out.\n3. **Add some flair:** Use decorative elements like stickers, washi tape, or even a small gift tag to add some personality to the gift.\n4. **Keep it a secret:** Make sure to wrap the gift discreetly and store it in a safe place until the surprise party.\n\n**Tips for a Book Wrap:**\n\n1. **Use a book wrap:** You can purchase a book wrap or create your own using a piece of paper or fabric. This will help keep the book clean and protect it during wrapping.\n2. **Add a dust jacket:** If the book has a removable dust jacket, consider adding it to the wrap to give it a more polished look.\n3. **Emphasize the title:** Highlight the book's title or author on the cover by using a marker or a sticker to create a focal point.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a beautifully wrapped book gift that's both thoughtful and visually appealing. Remember to keep it a secret until the big reveal, and I'm sure your friend will be thrilled with your gift!\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 4 added constraints.\n2) For the 4 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 4 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 4 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 4 added constraints are:\n   - Attending a themed surprise birthday party for a close friend this weekend.\n   - Chosen a book as a gift that aligns with the theme.\n   - Request for guidance on how to wrap the present neatly to ensure it looks both attractive and thoughtful.\n   - Response should carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n2) Discrimination of whether the answer satisfies each constraint:\n   - **Constraint 1:** The answer mentions the surprise party and provides wrapping tips, satisfying this constraint.

Can you guide me on how to wrap the present neatly to ensure it looks both attractive and thoughtful? Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 5 constraints#\nWhat a wonderful gesture! I'd be delighted to help you wrap your book gift in a way that's both attractive and thoughtful.\n\nTo create a beautiful and meaningful wrapping, I'll provide you with a step-by-step guide. Since the party has a \"Literature and Classics\" theme, we'll incorporate elements that pay homage to the literary world.\n\nMaterials needed:\n\n* Gift wrapping paper with a classic or literary-inspired design (e.g., book covers, scrolls, or vintage book illustrations)\n* A coordinating ribbon or twine\n* Gift tag or bookplate with a literary quote or the birthday person's name\n* Scissors\n* Tape\n* Optional: decorative items like bookmarks, book lights, or a small bookmark charm\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions:\n\n1. **Choose a wrapping paper**: Select a wrapping paper that complements the book's cover or the party's color scheme. You can opt for a paper with a classic design, such as a vintage book cover, a scroll, or a literary-inspired illustration.\n2. **Measure the book**: Measure the book's dimensions to determine how much wrapping paper you'll need. Make sure to leave some extra paper around the edges to create a neat and tidy wrapping.\n3. **Cut the wrapping paper**: Cut the wrapping paper to the desired size, leaving a little extra around the edges. You can use a wrapping paper cutter or scissors to achieve a clean cut.\n4. **Place the book on the paper**: Position the book in the center of the wrapping paper, ensuring it's aligned with the edges of the paper.\n5. **Fold and crease the paper**: Fold one edge of the paper over the book and crease it with your finger or a bone folder. Repeat this process with the other edges, creating a neat and crisp fold.\n6. **Tuck and tuck**: Tuck the edges of the paper under the book, making sure they're even and symmetrical. You can use a small piece of tape to secure the paper in place if needed.\n7. **Add a ribbon or twine**: Tie a ribbon or twine around the book, just above the folded edges. This will add a touch of elegance and create a beautiful finishing touch.\n8. **Add a gift tag or bookplate**: Attach a gift tag or bookplate with a literary quote or the birthday person's name. This will add a personal touch and make the gift even more special.\n9. **Add decorative items (optional)**: If you'd like to add some extra flair, you can attach a bookmark, book light, or a small bookmark charm to the ribbon or twine.\n10. **Final touches**: Fluff out the wrapping paper to ensure it's even and smooth. Make any necessary adjustments to the folds or edges.\n\nTips and Variations:\n\n* To add an extra layer of literary flair, you can include a small note or card with a quote from the book or a message that resonates with the birthday person's love of literature.\n* Consider using a book-themed wrapping paper with a quote or illustration that resonates with the book you've chosen.\n* If you're short on time, you can use a pre-made gift bag or a reusable tote bag with a literary-inspired design.\n* To make the gift even more special, you can include a bookmark or a small book-related item, such as a booklight or a bookmark charm.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create a beautifully wrapped gift that's sure to impress your friend and fit perfectly with the \"Literature and Classics\" theme.

If the dimensions of the matrices do not match, throw an std::invalid_argument exception.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 4 constraints#\nHere is the C++ implementation of the Matrix class as per your requirements:\n\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <stdexcept>\n\nclass Matrix {\nprivate:\n    int rows;\n    int cols;\n    std::vector<int> data;\n\npublic:\n    Matrix(int rows, int cols) : rows(rows), cols(cols) {\n        data.resize(rows * cols, 0);\n    }\n\n    int& operator()(int row, int col) {\n        if (row < 0 || row >= rows || col < 0 || col >= cols) {\n            throw std::out_of_range(\"Matrix index out of bounds\");\n        }\n        return data[row * cols + col];\n    }\n\n    const int& operator()(int row, int col) const {\n        if (row < 0 || row >= rows || col < 0 || col >= cols) {\n            throw std::out_of_range(\"Matrix index out of bounds\");\n        }\n        return data[row * cols + col];\n    }\n\n    Matrix operator+(const Matrix& other) const {\n        if (rows!= other.rows || cols!= other.cols) {\n            throw std::invalid_argument(\"Matrix dimensions do not match\");\n        }\n        Matrix result(rows, cols);\n        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {\n                result(i, j) = (*this)(i, j) + other(i, j);\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the implementation:\n\n1.  The `Matrix` class has three member variables: `rows`, `cols`, and `data`. The `rows` and `cols` variables store the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively. The `data` variable is a 1D vector that stores the matrix elements.\n2.  The constructor `Matrix(int rows, int cols)` initializes the `rows`, `cols`, and `data` variables. It resizes the `data` vector to the correct size and initializes all elements to 0.\n3.  The `operator()` method allows accessing individual elements of the matrix using the row and column indices. It performs bounds checking and throws an `std::out_of_range` exception if the indices are out of bounds.\n4.  The `operator+` method performs matrix addition. It takes another `Matrix` as an argument and returns a new `Matrix` with the sum of the two matrices. If the dimensions of the matrices do not match, it throws an `std::invalid_argument` exception.\n\nYou can use this class to create and manipulate matrices in your C++ program. For example:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    Matrix m1(2, 3);\n    Matrix m2(2, 3);\n\n    m1(0, 0) = 1;\n    m1(0, 1) = 2;\n    m1(0, 2) = 3;\n    m1(1, 0) = 4;\n    m1(1, 1) = 5;\n    m1(1, 2) = 6;\n\n    m2(0, 0) = 7;\n    m2(0, 1) = 8;\n    m2(0, 2) = 9;\n    m2(1, 0) = 10;\n    m2(1, 1) = 11;\n    m2(1, 2) = 12;\n\n    Matrix result = m1 + m2;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {\n            std::cout << result(i, j) << \" \";\n        }\n        std::cout << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates two matrices `m1` and `m2`, adds them together using the `operator+` method, and prints the resulting matrix.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 4 added constraints.\n2) For the 4 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 4 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 4 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 4 added constraints are:\n   - The class should have a constructor that takes the number of rows and columns as arguments and initializes the matrix with zeros.\n   - Implement the operator() method that allows access to individual elements of the matrix using the row and column indices.
