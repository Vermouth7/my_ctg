He tried to remember how he had gotten home, but his memories were hazy and fragmented. He vaguely recalled a night out with friends at the local bar, laughing and joking, but the rest was a blur.\n\nAs he stumbled out of bed, he noticed a half-empty bottle of vodka on the nightstand. He groaned, remembering the countless times he had promised himself he would quit drinking, only to give in to the temptation once again.\n\nHe staggered to the kitchen, his mind foggy and his body aching. He poured himself a glass of water and downed it quickly, trying to rehydrate after a night of heavy drinking. As he looked around the room, he noticed a piece of paper on the counter with a scribbled note: \"Meet me at the bar at 10pm. -J\".\n\nJack's eyes widened as he realized that he had been out with his friends again, and that he must have lost his phone or wallet somewhere along the way. He rummaged through his pockets, but found nothing except a crumpled up receipt from a convenience store.\n\nAs he searched the room, he found a wallet on the coffee table, but it wasn't his. He opened it and found a driver's license, a credit card, and a handful of cash. A name on the license caught his eye: \"James\". Jack's mind raced as he tried to piece together what had happened the night before.\n\nHe decided to take a shower and try to clear his head. As the hot water washed over him, he felt a sense of clarity wash away the fogginess of the night before. He realized that he had lost his phone, his wallet, and his dignity. But as he got out of the shower, he also felt a sense of determination. He was going to find his phone, get his life back on track, and quit drinking once and for all.\n\nAs he got dressed and headed out the door, Jack knew that it wouldn't be easy. But he was ready to face the challenges ahead and start fresh. He took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and walked out into the bright sunlight, ready to take on the day."}

We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME).  We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing. The code, dataset, visualizations, and an interactive demo notebook are available in the supplemental materials.", "result": "Here is a summary of the text in one sentence within 20 words, starting with the word \"We\" and containing the word \"activations\":\n\nWe identify localized, editable computations in language models, using activations to manipulate factual associations and improve model editing."}

In the realm of machine learning, the concept of knowledge distillation involves transferring the expertise of a complex model to a simpler, more compact one.\n2. Machine learning practitioners use knowledge distillation to migrate the insights gained from a large, sophisticated model to a smaller, more efficient one.\n3. The process of knowledge distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from a larger, more complex neural network to a smaller, more manageable model.\n4. In the context of machine learning, knowledge distillation refers to the technique of extracting the key findings from a large model and applying them to a smaller, more streamlined model.\n5. Through knowledge distillation, machine learning models can transfer their accumulated knowledge from a large, complex model to a smaller, more lightweight model that is easier to deploy and maintain."}
