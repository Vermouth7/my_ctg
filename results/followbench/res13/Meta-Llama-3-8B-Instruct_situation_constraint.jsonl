Then, it returns a list comprehension of the elements that have a count of 1, sorted in ascending order.\n\nHere is how you can test the function:\n\n```python\nprint(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))\n```\n\nThis will output: `[0, 2, 9, 123]`"}

The inner list comprehension `[x for x in l if l.count(x) == n]` creates a new list that includes only the elements that appear exactly `n` times in the original list.\n2. The outer set comprehension `set([...])` converts this list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates.\n3. The sorted function sorts the resulting set in ascending order.\n4. The outer list comprehension `sorted([...])` converts the sorted set back to a list.\n\nFor example, if you call `unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1)`, the function will return `[0, 2, 9, 123]`, which are the elements that appear exactly once in the original list, sorted in ascending order."}

The resulting list is then sorted in ascending order.\n\nThe median of the filtered list is calculated by finding the middle element if the length of the list is odd, or the average of the two middle elements if the length is even. The mean is calculated by summing all elements and dividing by the length of the list.\n\nThe function returns a tuple containing the filtered list, the median, and the mean."}

I'd be happy to guide you on how to wrap your book gift attractively and thoughtfully. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Theme Considerations:**\nBefore we dive into the wrapping process, let's consider the theme of the party. Since it's a surprise birthday party, I assume the theme is a surprise to you as well. If you have any information about the theme, please share it with me, and I can provide more tailored suggestions.\n\n**Basic Wrapping Supplies:**\n\n* Gift wrapping paper (choose a design that fits the theme or a neutral color)\n* Gift wrapping tape (clear or matching the paper's color)\n* Gift tag or card (optional)\n* Ribbon or twine (optional)\n* Gift box (if you want to add an extra layer of protection and presentation)\n\n**Wrapping Steps:**\n\n1. **Measure the book:** Measure the book's length, width, and height to determine how much wrapping paper you'll need. Add a little extra to the measurements to ensure you have enough paper to cover the book completely.\n2. **Cut the wrapping paper:** Use a straightedge or a paper cutter to cut the wrapping paper to the desired size. You can also use a wrapping paper with a pre-cut design or a self-adhesive backing to make the process easier.\n3. **Place the book on the paper:** Position the book in the center of the wrapping paper, ensuring it's aligned with the paper's edges.\n4. **Fold and crease the paper:** Fold one edge of the paper over the book, creating a 45-degree angle.

For example, if the theme is literary, you could add a book-related sticker or a bookmark with a special message.\n* Keep it simple: Remember, the focus is on the gift itself, not the wrapping. Keep the wrapping simple and elegant, and let the book be the star of the show.\n\nBy following these steps and considering the theme, you'll create a beautifully wrapped gift that your friend will cherish.

The `SavingsAccount` class inherits from `BankAccount` and adds the following method:\n\t* `apply_interest`: Calculates and adds interest to the account balance based on the provided interest rate.\n\nYou can use the classes like this:\n```\naccount = BankAccount(\"123456\", 1000)\nprint(account.deposit(500))  # Deposited $500.00. New balance: $1500.00\nprint(account.withdraw(200))  # Withdrew $200.00.

New balance: $1030.00\nprint(savings_account.get_balance())  # 1030.0\n```\nNote that the `SavingsAccount` class uses the `super()` function to call the `__init__` method of the `BankAccount` class, which initializes the account number and balance.

The `data` is a 1D vector where each element is an integer. The `rows` and `cols` are used to calculate the index of each element in the `data` vector.\n\nThe class provides methods to get the number of rows and columns, get and set the value at a given position in the matrix. The constructor initializes the matrix with the given number of rows and columns and allocates memory for the `data` vector.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this class:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    Matrix m(3, 4); // Create a 3x4 matrix\n\n    m.setValue(0, 0, 1); // Set value at position (0,0) to 1\n    m.setValue(1, 1, 2); // Set value at position (1,1) to 2\n    m.setValue(2, 2, 3); // Set value at position (2,2) to 3\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < m.getRows(); i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < m.getCols(); j++) {\n            std::cout << m.getValue(i, j) << \" \";\n        }\n        std::cout << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n1 0 0 0 \n0 2 0 0 \n0 0 3 0 \n```"}
