The list comprehension `[x for x in set(l)]` iterates over the set and creates a new list with all the unique elements.\n3. `l.count(x) == 1` checks if each element `x` appears only once in the original list `l`.\n4. The `sorted` function is used to sort the resulting list in ascending order.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```\n>>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n[0, 2, 9, 123]\n```\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the use of `l.count(x)`, which is not very efficient for large lists. If you need a more efficient solution, you can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element and then create a new list with the elements that appear only once. Here is an alternative implementation:\n```\ndef unique(l: list):\n    counts = {}\n    for x in l:\n        counts[x] = counts.get(x, 0) + 1\n    return sorted([x for x, count in counts.items() if count == 1])\n```\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and is more efficient for large lists."}
{"prompt_new": " def unique(l: list, n: int): \"\"\"Return a list with elements that appear exactly n times in the given list, sorted in ascending order >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1) [0, 2, 9, 123] \"\"\" ", "result": "Here is a Python function that does what you described:\n```\ndef unique(l: list, n: int):\n    count_dict = {}\n    for item in l:\n        if item in count_dict:\n            count_dict[item] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[item] = 1\n    return sorted([item for item, count in count_dict.items() if count == n])\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. We create an empty dictionary `count_dict` to store the count of each element in the input list.\n2. We iterate over the input list, and for each element, we check if it's already in the dictionary. If it is, we increment its count by 1. If it's not, we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n3. We use a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the elements that have a count of `n` in the dictionary. We use the `sorted` function to sort this list in ascending order.\n4. We return the resulting list.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\n>>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1)\n[0, 2, 9, 123]\n```\nI hope this helps!

The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each element in the list.\n2. A list comprehension is used to create a list of elements that appear exactly `n` times in the list.\n3. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list of unique elements in ascending order.\n4. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the unique elements.\n5. The function returns a tuple containing the list of unique elements and their sum.\n\nYou can test the function with the example you provided:\n\n```Python\nprint(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1))  # Output: ([0, 2, 9, 123], 134)\n```"}

It then sorts this filtered list in ascending order. The median of this list is calculated and returned as the second output. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements if the list has an even number of elements, and as the middle element if the list has an odd number of elements."}

{"prompt_new": "I am developing a web application using Flask in VS Code. The primary directory of my project is called 'ShopApp'.
