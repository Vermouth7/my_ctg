He couldn't remember the last time he had a good night, or a good day, for that matter. His life had been a blur of one disappointment after another, and he had lost count of the number of times he had found himself sitting in this exact same spot, wondering how he had ended up here.\n\nAs he gazed down at the amber liquid in his glass, he thought back to the events that had led him to this moment. He had been feeling lost and alone for weeks, unable to shake the feeling that he was stuck in a rut. He had tried to distract himself with work, with hobbies, with anything that would take his mind off his troubles. But nothing seemed to work.\n\nOne night, in a moment of desperation, he had stumbled upon a half-empty bottle of vodka in his cabinet. He had poured himself a shot, and as the liquor burned its way down his throat, he felt a fleeting sense of relief. Maybe, just maybe, this would be the solution to all his problems.\n\nBut as the night wore on, he found himself drinking more and more, trying to drown his sorrows in the bottle. He remembered fragments of the night - the laughter, the tears, the arguments - but the details were fuzzy, and the next morning he woke up with a pounding headache and a sense of regret.\n\nAs he sat at the bar now, he couldn't help but think that he was repeating the same pattern all over again. He had lost himself in the vodka, and now he was trying to forget. But the more he drank, the more he felt like he was losing himself, piece by piece.\n\nThe bartender, a kind-faced woman with a warm smile, came over to refill his drink. \"You okay, hon?\" she asked, her voice soft with concern.\n\nHe looked up at her, feeling a lump form in his throat. \"I'm fine,\" he lied, trying to muster up a smile.\n\nShe nodded, but her eyes told him that she didn't believe him. \"You know, sometimes it's okay to talk about what's going on,\" she said, her voice gentle. \"Sometimes it's okay to ask for help.\"\n\nHe nodded, feeling a spark of gratitude towards her. Maybe, just maybe, she was right. Maybe it was time to stop trying to drown his sorrows in vodka, and start facing his problems head-on.\n\nWith a newfound sense of determination, he pushed his glass away and stood up, his eyes scanning the room for a way out. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but he was ready to start the long journey of finding himself again. And as he walked out of the bar, he felt a glimmer of hope that he hadn't felt in a long time.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify the 1 added constraint.\n2) Please descriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# satisfies the 1 added constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 1 element ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies the 1 added constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 1 added constraint is: \"write a story that describes a man.\"\n\n2) The #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# does satisfy the 1 added constraint, as the story is centered around a man who is experiencing struggles with alcohol and his emotions.\n\n3) ['YES']"}}]}
