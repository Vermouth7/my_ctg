The list comprehension `[x for x in set(l)]` iterates over the set and creates a new list with all the unique elements.\n3. `l.count(x) == 1` checks if each element `x` appears only once in the original list `l`.\n4. The `sorted` function is used to sort the resulting list in ascending order.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```\n>>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n[0, 2, 9, 123]\n```\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the use of `l.count(x)`, which is not very efficient for large lists. If you need a more efficient solution, you can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element and then create a new list with the elements that appear only once. Here is an alternative implementation:\n```\ndef unique(l: list):\n    counts = {}\n    for x in l:\n        counts[x] = counts.get(x, 0) + 1\n    return sorted([x for x, count in counts.items() if count == 1])\n```\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and is more efficient for large lists.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify the 1 added constraint.\n2) Please descriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# satisfies the 1 added constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 1 element ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies the 1 added constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The added constraint is: \"Return a list with elements that appear only once, sorted in ascending order.\"\n\n2) The #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# does satisfy the added constraint, as it correctly returns a list of elements that appear only once in the input list and sorts them in ascending order.\n\n3) ['YES']"}}]}

We create an empty dictionary `count_dict` to store the count of each element in the input list.\n2. We iterate over the input list, and for each element, we check if it's already in the dictionary. If it is, we increment its count by 1. If it's not, we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n3. We use a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the elements that have a count of `n` in the dictionary. We use the `sorted` function to sort this list in ascending order.\n4. We return the resulting list.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\n>>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1)\n[0, 2, 9, 123]\n```\nI hope this helps!

How can I improve my time management skills? Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint#\nHere are some tips to help you improve your time management skills as you start your new job:\n\n1. **Set clear goals and priorities**: Start by setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for your new job. Identify your top priorities and focus on the most important tasks first.\n2. **Create a schedule**: Plan out your day, week, or month in advance. Use a planner, calendar, or app to schedule your tasks and set reminders. Be realistic about how much time each task will take, and leave some buffer time for unexpected tasks or interruptions.\n3. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and work on each one for 25 minutes at a time, followed by a 5-minute break. This technique can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n4. **Prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance**: Identify the most critical tasks that need to be completed, and tackle them first. Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks into four quadrants: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and not urgent or important.\n5. **Learn to say no**: Don't take on too much at once. Be mindful of your workload and avoid overcommitting yourself. Learn to say no to tasks that are not aligned with your priorities or that you simply cannot fit into your schedule.\n6. **Avoid multitasking**: Focus on one task at a time to ensure you complete it efficiently and effectively. Multitasking can lead to mistakes, decreased productivity, and increased stress.\n7. **Take breaks**: Take regular breaks to recharge and refocus.

Things don't always go as planned, and being flexible can help you adapt to changes and stay productive.\n13. **Use time-blocking**: Schedule large blocks of uninterrupted time to focus on important tasks. This can help you stay in flow and make significant progress on complex projects.\n14. **Avoid procrastination**: Procrastination can be a major time management killer. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and focus on making progress rather than perfection.\n15. **Practice time estimation**: Improve your ability to estimate the time required for tasks. This can help you avoid under or overestimating the time needed for a task and ensure you have enough time to complete it.\n\nRemember, time management is a skill that takes practice, so be patient and flexible as you develop your skills.

Can you guide me on how to wrap the present neatly to ensure it looks both attractive and thoughtful? Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 4 constraints#\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to wrap a book beautifully and thoughtfully for your friend's surprise birthday party:\n\n**Materials needed:**\n\n* The book\n* Wrapping paper of your choice (choose a design that matches the theme or is a favorite of your friend's)\n* Gift wrapping tape\n* Ribbon or gift tag\n* Optional: gift box, gift bag, or decorative items (e.g., stickers, bows, etc.)\n\n**Step 1: Prepare the Book**\n\nBefore wrapping, make sure the book is clean and free of any dust or debris. You can also consider adding a bookmark or a personalized note inside the book to make it an even more special gift.\n\n**Step 2: Measure and Cut the Wrapping Paper**\n\nMeasure the book's dimensions to determine how much wrapping paper you'll need. Add a little extra to ensure you have enough to wrap the book securely. Cut the wrapping paper to the desired size, leaving a little extra around the edges for folding.\n\n**Step 3: Place the Book on the Wrapping Paper**\n\nPosition the book in the center of the wrapping paper, making sure it's aligned with the edges of the paper. You can use a ruler or a straightedge to help you achieve a straight line.\n\n**Step 4: Fold and Crease the Paper**\n\nFold one edge of the paper over the book, creating a straight crease. Repeat this process with the other edges, making sure to create a crisp crease each time. This will help you achieve a neat and sharp fold.\n\n**Step 5: Fold the Paper Around the Book**\n\nStart folding the paper around the book, making sure to tuck the edges under the book as you go. Use your fingers to smooth out any wrinkles or air pockets.\n\n**Step 6: Secure the Paper with Tape**\n\nUse gift wrapping tape to secure the paper in place, starting at the bottom edge and working your way up. Make sure the tape is not too tight, as you want to avoid creasing the paper.\n\n**Step 7: Add a Ribbon or Gift Tag**\n\nAdd a ribbon or gift tag to the top of the wrapped book. You can choose a ribbon that matches the wrapping paper or a contrasting color to add some visual interest. If you're using a gift tag, you can attach it to the ribbon or the wrapping paper.\n\n**Step 8: Add Decorative Touches (Optional)**\n\nIf you want to add some extra flair, you can use decorative items like stickers, bows, or gift embellishments to make the wrapping more festive.\n\n**Step 9: Place the Wrapped Book in a Gift Box or Bag (Optional)**\n\nIf you want to add an extra layer of presentation, consider placing the wrapped book in a gift box or bag. This can add a touch of elegance and make the gift feel more special.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a gift wrapping mat or a piece of cardboard to help you create a crisp crease when folding the paper.\n* Experiment with different wrapping paper designs and textures to add visual interest to your gift.\n* Consider adding a personalized note or a bookmark with a special message to make the gift even more thoughtful.\n* If you're short on time, you can use a gift bag or a gift box to simplify the wrapping process.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to create a beautifully wrapped book that your friend will appreciate. Remember to have fun and be creative with the wrapping process, and don't hesitate to add your own personal touches to make the gift even more special.

Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 5 constraints#\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to wrap your book gift neatly and thoughtfully for the \"Literature and Classics\" themed surprise birthday party:\n\n**Materials needed:**\n\n* Gift wrapping paper (choose a design that complements the theme, such as a classic literary-inspired pattern or a subtle book-themed design)\n* Gift wrapping tape\n* Gift tag or card\n* Ribbon or twine (optional)\n* Decorative elements (optional, e.g., book-themed stickers, bookmarks, or literary quotes)\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n\n1. **Choose a wrapping paper:** Select a wrapping paper that complements the theme. You can opt for a classic design, such as a simple white or cream-colored paper with a subtle texture, or go for a more bold and eye-catching design that features literary quotes, book covers, or author portraits.\n2. **Measure the book:** Measure the book's dimensions to ensure you have enough wrapping paper. Leave a small margin (about 1-2 inches) around the book to allow for easy wrapping and to prevent the paper from bunching up.\n3. **Cut the wrapping paper:** Cut the wrapping paper to the desired size, leaving the margins you measured earlier.\n4. **Place the book on the paper:** Position the book in the center of the wrapping paper, ensuring it is aligned with the edges of the paper.\n5. **Fold and crease the paper:** Fold the paper over the book, creating a straight crease along the edge of the paper. Repeat this process for all four sides, making sure to create crisp creases.\n6. **Tuck and fold the edges:** Tuck the edges of the paper under the book, creating a neat and tidy fold. You can use a bone folder or a credit card to create a sharp crease.\n7. **Secure with tape:** Use gift wrapping tape to secure the paper in place, starting from the bottom edge and working your way up. Make sure the tape is not visible from the outside.\n8. **Add a gift tag or card:** Attach a gift tag or card to the wrapping paper, including a personal message or a quote from the book. You can also add a bookmark or a small book-themed decoration to the gift tag.\n9. **Add a ribbon or twine:** If desired, add a ribbon or twine around the gift to give it a more polished look. You can tie a simple bow or create a more intricate design.\n10. **Final touches:** Take a step back and admire your handiwork! You can add any additional decorative elements, such as book-themed stickers or literary quotes, to make the gift even more special.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* To add an extra touch, consider wrapping the book in a reusable cloth bag or a book-themed pouch.\n* Use a book-themed wrapping paper or a paper with a vintage or distressed look to give the gift a more unique and literary feel.\n* If you're short on time, you can use a pre-made gift bag or a gift box with a literary-inspired design.\n* Consider personalizing the gift with a custom bookplate or a handwritten note inside the book.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create a beautifully wrapped gift that will delight your friend and fit perfectly with the \"Literature and Classics\" theme.
