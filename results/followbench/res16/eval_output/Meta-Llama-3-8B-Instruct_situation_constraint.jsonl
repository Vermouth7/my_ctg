One of these CSS files, named 'styles.css', is heavily used across all the HTML files in the 'VIEWS' directory to style the web pages.\n   - Constraint 4: To facilitate database operations, 'app.py' employs a module named 'db_ops.py' which resides in the main 'ShopApp' directory. This module contains functions like 'add_product' and 'get_user_details'.\n   - Constraint 5: The 'user.py' has a dependency on an external library named 'bcrypt' to hash and verify user passwords.\n\n2) Discrimination of whether the answer satisfies each constraint:\n   - Constraint 1: YES (The answer correctly describes the contents of the 'MODELS' directory and the classes defined in 'product.py' and 'user.py'.)\n   - Constraint 2: YES (The answer includes the 'VIEWS' directory and lists the HTML files present, along with their purpose.)\n   - Constraint 3: YES (The answer mentions the 'STATIC' directory and the usage of 'styles.css' across the HTML files.)\n   - Constraint 4: YES (The answer correctly states the existence of 'db_ops.py' and its functions used in 'app.py'.)\n   - Constraint 5: YES (The answer notes the dependency of 'user.py' on the 'bcrypt' library.)\n\n3) Final output:\n```python\n['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']\n```"}}]}

Can you guide me on how to wrap the present neatly to ensure it looks both attractive and thoughtful? Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 4 constraints#\nWhat a wonderful gesture! Wrapping a gift thoughtfully can make it even more special and meaningful. I'd be happy to guide you through the process.\n\n**Choosing the Right Wrapping Paper**\n\nFor a themed surprise birthday party, you'll want to choose wrapping paper that complements the theme. Since you've chosen a book as a gift, you might consider wrapping paper with a literary or book-related design. You can also opt for a neutral-colored paper that will allow the book to be the focal point.\n\n**Preparing the Gift**\n\nBefore wrapping, make sure the book is clean and free of any dust or debris. You might also consider adding a bookmark or a small note to make it a more personal gift.\n\n**Wrapping Techniques**\n\nHere are some tips to help you wrap the gift neatly and attractively:\n\n1. **Measure the book**: Measure the book's dimensions to ensure you have enough wrapping paper. You can use a wrapping paper with a grid pattern to help you measure accurately.\n2. **Cut the wrapping paper**: Cut a piece of wrapping paper slightly larger than the book's dimensions. Leave a small margin (about 1-2 inches) around the book to ensure a snug fit.\n3. **Create a crease**: Fold the wrapping paper in half lengthwise, creating a crease in the middle. This will help you find the center of the paper and ensure a symmetrical wrap.\n4. **Place the book**: Position the book in the center of the wrapping paper, aligning it with the crease you created.\n5. **Fold and tuck**: Fold one edge of the paper over the book and tuck it under the book, creating a crisp fold. Repeat this process with the other edges, working your way around the book.\n6. **Secure with tape**: Use clear tape to secure the paper in place, making sure it's tight and even. You can also use a small piece of tape to hold the paper in place while you work on the next edge.\n7. **Add embellishments**: Consider adding a small gift tag or a ribbon to give the gift a personal touch. You can also add some decorative paper or a small book-themed sticker to enhance the wrapping.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* To add an extra layer of protection, you can wrap the book in a piece of tissue paper or a book cover before wrapping it in the decorative paper.\n* If you're using a large or heavy book, you might need to use more wrapping paper or add additional support to keep the paper from tearing.\n* Consider using a gift box or a book-shaped gift box to add an extra layer of protection and make the gift more special.\n* If you're short on time, you can use a pre-made gift bag or a book bag with a decorative design.\n\n**Final Touches**\n\nOnce you've wrapped the gift, take a step back and admire your handiwork. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure the wrapping is even and secure. You can also add a personal message or a birthday card to make the gift even more special.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you'll be able to create a beautifully wrapped gift that your friend will appreciate and cherish.

Make sure your response carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n#Answer of Initial Instruction + 5 constraints#\nWhat a wonderful gesture! I'd be delighted to help you wrap your book gift in a way that's both attractive and thoughtful. Here's a step-by-step guide to ensure your presentation is a literary masterpiece:\n\n**Materials needed:**\n\n* Gift wrapping paper with a classic, timeless design (e.g., stripes, polka dots, or a subtle literary-inspired pattern)\n* Gift wrapping tape (in a coordinating color)\n* A ribbon or twine (optional)\n* Gift tag or card\n* Scissors\n* A small piece of cardboard or a paper insert (optional)\n\n**Step-by-Step Wrapping Instructions:**\n\n1. **Choose the right wrapping paper**: Select a paper that complements the book's cover and the literary theme. You can opt for a paper with a subtle design that won't overpower the book's cover.\n2. **Measure the book**: Measure the book's dimensions to ensure you have enough wrapping paper. Leave a small margin (about 1-2 inches) around the book to create a neat and tidy wrap.\n3. **Cut the wrapping paper**: Cut the wrapping paper to the desired size, leaving the margins you measured earlier.\n4. **Place the book on the paper**: Position the book in the center of the wrapping paper, ensuring it's aligned with the edges of the paper.\n5. **Fold and crease the paper**: Fold one edge of the paper over the book, creating a crisp crease. Repeat this process with the other edges, making sure to maintain a symmetrical fold.\n6. **Secure with tape**: Use gift wrapping tape to hold the paper in place, starting from the bottom edge and working your way up. Apply gentle pressure to avoid creasing the paper.\n7. **Add a ribbon or twine (optional)**: If you want to add a touch of elegance, tie a ribbon or twine around the book, securing it with a bow. This can also serve as a bookmark.\n8. **Add a gift tag or card**: Attach a gift tag or card to the ribbon or twine with a personal message or a quote related to the book or the birthday person's love for literature.\n9. **Add a paper insert (optional)**: If you want to add an extra touch, place a small piece of cardboard or paper insert between the wrapping paper and the book to create a neat, flat surface. This can also help prevent the book's cover from getting creased.\n10. **Finishing touches**: Fluff out any wrinkles or creases in the wrapping paper, and your gift is ready to be presented to your friend!\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* To add an extra layer of literary flair, you can include a bookmark with a quote or a note about the book.\n* Consider using a book-themed wrapping paper or a paper with a vintage or distressed look to add an extra layer of whimsy.\n* If you're feeling crafty, you can create a custom wrapping paper with a design inspired by the book's cover or a relevant literary motif.\n* Don't be afraid to get creative with the wrapping paper's design or the placement of the book on the paper. You can create a unique and eye-catching presentation that reflects your friend's personality and love for literature.\n\nWith these steps and tips, you'll be able to create a beautifully wrapped gift that's sure to impress your friend and make their literary-themed birthday party a memorable one.

It performs bounds checking and throws an `std::out_of_range` exception if the indices are out of bounds.\n*   The `operator+` method performs matrix addition by taking another `Matrix` as an argument and returning a new `Matrix` with the sum of the two matrices. It checks if the dimensions of the matrices match and throws an `std::invalid_argument` exception if they do not.\n\nYou can use the `Matrix` class as follows:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    Matrix m1(3, 3);\n    Matrix m2(3, 3);\n\n    m1(0, 0) = 1;\n    m1(0, 1) = 2;\n    m1(0, 2) = 3;\n    m1(1, 0) = 4;\n    m1(1, 1) = 5;\n    m1(1, 2) = 6;\n    m1(2, 0) = 7;\n    m1(2, 1) = 8;\n    m1(2, 2) = 9;\n\n    m2(0, 0) = 10;\n    m2(0, 1) = 11;\n    m2(0, 2) = 12;\n    m2(1, 0) = 13;\n    m2(1, 1) = 14;\n    m2(1, 2) = 15;\n    m2(2, 0) = 16;\n    m2(2, 1) = 17;\n    m2(2, 2) = 18;\n\n    Matrix result = m1 + m2;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {\n            std::cout << result(i, j) << \" \";\n        }\n        std::cout << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates two matrices `m1` and `m2` and adds them using the `operator+` method. The result is printed to the console.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 4 added constraints.\n2) For the 4 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 4 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 4 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 4 added constraints are:\n   - The class should have a constructor that takes the number of rows and columns as arguments and initializes the matrix with zeros.\n   - Implement the operator() method that allows access to individual elements of the matrix using the row and column indices.
