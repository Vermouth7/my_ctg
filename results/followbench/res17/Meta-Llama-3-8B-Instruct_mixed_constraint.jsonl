Time was a blur when you were as drunk as he was.\n\nAs he swayed slightly, his hand brushed against a familiar shape in his pocket. The small bottle of vodka, half-empty from the night before, was still there. He pulled it out, cradling it like a security blanket. The cool glass felt comforting against his palm.\n\nJack took a swig, letting the burn of the liquor wash over him. He closed his eyes, letting the familiar haze of intoxication cloud his thoughts. He didn't want to think about the argument with Sarah, or the missed phone call from his boss, or the crushing feeling of being completely lost and alone.\n\nAs the vodka took hold, Jack's thoughts began to fog, and he felt himself slipping away from the present moment. He stumbled back into the alleyway, the sounds of the city growing distant and muffled. The world around him became a haze of neon lights and distant laughter, and he let himself get swept up in the vortex of forgetfulness.\n\nFor a while, he was free from the weight of his troubles. He was just a man, lost in the city, with nothing but his vodka and his own thoughts to keep him company. And in that moment, he was okay with that."}

Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch.
