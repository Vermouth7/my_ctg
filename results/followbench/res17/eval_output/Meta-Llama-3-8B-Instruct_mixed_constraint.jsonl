Kunsthistorikerin Elizabeth Lev leads a masterful lecture, taking us along the ceiling paintings of the famous building, and Michelangelo's vivid description of traditional stories. Through this lecture, we can return to the past 500 years. This lecture makes us think that we are looking at the Sixtine Chapel, and we are asking ourselves, \"Who am I? Where am I in this big theater of life?\"\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 3 added constraints.\n2) For the 3 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 3 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 3 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 3 added constraints are:\n   - Use a friendly and inviting tone.\n   - There should be 5 sentences in the translated text.\n   - Do not split the sentences into separated lines.\n\n2) Discrimination of whether the answer satisfies each constraint:\n   - The answer uses a friendly and inviting tone: **YES**\n   - The translated text contains 5 sentences: **NO** (the translation does not clearly separate into 5 distinct sentences)\n   - The sentences are not split into separated lines: **YES**\n\n3) Final output:\n```python\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n```"}}]}

As a cultural historian, Elizabeth Lev takes us along the frescoes of the famous building and Michelangelo's lively depiction of traditional stories, showing how the painter went beyond the religious iconography of the time to create new art.
