The 'user.py' file defines a class 'User' with attributes 'username' and 'email'.\n   - Constraint 2: Within the 'ShopApp' directory, there's another subdirectory named 'VIEWS'. Inside 'VIEWS', there are multiple HTML files like 'dashboard.html', 'login.html', and 'register.html'. These HTML files are rendered by routes defined in 'app.py'.\n   - Constraint 3: Within 'ShopApp', there's a folder called 'STATIC' housing various static files like CSS styles and JavaScript scripts. One of these CSS files, named 'styles.css', is heavily used across all the HTML files in the 'VIEWS' directory to style the web pages.\n   - Constraint 4: To facilitate database operations, 'app.py' employs a module named 'db_ops.py' which resides in the main 'ShopApp' directory.

This will help you establish a clear boundary between work and personal life.\n2. **Establish a routine**: Set a schedule for your workday, including regular breaks and time for your child's needs. Sticking to a routine will help you stay focused and ensure your child knows when you're available for them.\n3. **Use childcare support**: If possible, consider enlisting the help of a partner, family member, or babysitter to watch your child while you work. Even a few hours of childcare can make a big difference in your productivity.\n4. **Take advantage of naptime**: If your child still takes naps, use this time to focus on your work. You can also use this time to take a power nap yourself to recharge.\n5. **Use noise-cancelling headphones**: If your child is old enough to play independently, use noise-cancelling headphones to block out distractions and stay focused.\n6. **Break tasks into smaller chunks**: Large tasks can be overwhelming when working from home with a child.

This can help them develop self-soothing skills and reduce distractions.\n9. **Schedule playtime**: Make time for play and interaction with your child. This will help you recharge and maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n10. **Practice self-care**: Working from home with a child can be stressful. Don't forget to prioritize self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or reading, to maintain your physical and mental well-being.\n11. **Set boundaries with clients or colleagues**: Communicate your work-from-home situation with your clients or colleagues and set clear expectations for your availability and response times.\n12. **Take advantage of flexible work arrangements**: If possible, discuss flexible work arrangements with your employer, such as adjusting your schedule or working remotely for a few days a week.\n13. **Use your child's energy**: If your child is old enough, involve them in your work or use their energy to your advantage. For example, you can work while they play independently nearby or use their enthusiasm to fuel your creativity.\n14. **Stay organized**: Keep your digital and physical files organized, and use project management tools to stay on top of tasks and deadlines.\n15. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your work-from-home setup and adjust your strategies as needed. Life with a small child is unpredictable, and flexibility is key to maintaining productivity.\n\nRemember, working from home with a small child requires patience, flexibility, and creativity.

I'm happy to help you boost your productivity while juggling these responsibilities. Here are some tips to help you stay focused and efficient:\n\n1. **Create a dedicated workspace**: Designate a specific area of your home as your workspace and keep it organized and clutter-free. This will help you establish a clear boundary between work and personal life.\n2. **Establish a routine**: With a baby, routine is key. Create a schedule for your work hours, including regular breaks to care for your child. This will help you stay on track and ensure your work-life balance.\n3. **Prioritize self-care**: Working from home can be isolating, and with a new baby, it's essential to prioritize self-care. Schedule time for exercise, meditation, or hobbies to recharge and reduce stress.\n4. **Use time-blocking**: Divide your day into focused blocks of time (e.g., 90 minutes) followed by short breaks. This technique can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n5. **Take advantage of naptime**: Use your baby's naptime to work on tasks that require intense concentration. This can be a great opportunity to make progress on important projects.\n6. **Communicate with your partner**: If you have a partner, make sure to communicate your work schedule and needs.

Avoid consuming too much caffeine, as it can negatively impact your sleep and overall well-being.\n10. **Set boundaries with family and friends**: Establish clear boundaries with family and friends to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Let them know your work hours and avoid distractions during that time.\n11. **Use a'stop doing' list**: Identify tasks that are no longer essential or can be delegated, and eliminate them to free up time for more important tasks.\n12. **Take breaks to care for your baby**: Don't neglect your baby's needs! Take breaks to feed, soothe, or play with your child. This will help you stay energized and focused when you return to work.\n13. **Consider a 'baby-friendly' workspace**: If possible, set up a baby-friendly workspace, such as a playpen or baby gate, to keep your child nearby while you work.\n14. **Ask for help when needed**: Don't be afraid to ask for help from your partner, family, or friends when you need it. This can be a huge stress-reliever and allow you to focus on your work.\n15. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your productivity system and adjust it as needed. Life with a new baby and a pandemic is unpredictable, and your system should be flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be patient and kind to yourself as you navigate this new chapter in your life.

New balance: 1300\nprint(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1300\n\nsavings_account = SavingsAccount(\"9876543210\", 2000, 0.03)\nprint(savings_account.get_balance())  # Output: 2000\nprint(savings_account.apply_interest())  # Output: Applied interest. New balance: 2040\nprint(savings_account.get_balance())  # Output: 2040\n```\nNote that the interest rate is applied as a decimal value (e.g., 0.02 for 2% interest).\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 3 added constraints.\n2) For the 3 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 3 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 3 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 3 added constraints are:\n   - Create a SavingsAccount class that inherits from BankAccount.
