The last thing he remembered was leaving the bar with his friends, laughing and joking around. But now, he was alone, with no recollection of how he got here.\n\nAs he looked around, he noticed a small bottle of vodka on the ground next to him. He picked it up, examining it for any clues.

He recalled arguing with his girlfriend, Sarah, at the bar. They had been fighting a lot lately, and he didn't know why. He remembered feeling angry and helpless, and then...nothing.\n\nJack took another swig of the vodka, trying to fill in the gaps.

He was in an alleyway, not far from his apartment.

He knew he needed to talk to Sarah, to apologize and make things right.
