{"prompt_new": "What is the sole responsibility of business according to Milton Friedman, while also considering its implications on societal ethics?", "result": "assistant\n\nAccording to Milton Friedman, the sole responsibility of business is to increase its profits. In his 1970 article \"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits,\" Friedman argues that businesses should focus solely on making a profit and not be concerned with social or philanthropic activities. He believes that social responsibility is not the responsibility of businesses, but rather of individuals and government.\n\nFriedman's argument is based on the idea that businesses are not charities and should not be expected to sacrifice their profits for the benefit of society. He believes that businesses are in the business of making money, and that their primary goal should be to maximize shareholder value.\n\nHowever, this view has been criticized for being overly narrow and neglecting the potential positive impact that businesses can have on society. Some argue that businesses have a responsibility to consider the social and environmental impacts of their actions and to act in a way that benefits society as a whole.\n\nFrom a societal ethics perspective, Friedman's view can be seen as problematic for several reasons:\n\n1. Neglect of social and environmental concerns: Friedman's focus on profit maximization can lead businesses to neglect important social and environmental issues, such as environmental degradation, labor exploitation, and income inequality.\n2. Inadequate regulation: If businesses are solely focused on making a profit, they may not be held accountable for their actions and may engage in unethical behavior, such as price-fixing, pollution, and labor exploitation.\n3. Inequitable distribution of wealth: Friedman's view can lead to an unequal distribution of wealth, as those who are already wealthy are able to accumulate more wealth and power, while those who are less fortunate are left behind.\n4. Lack of accountability: If businesses are not held accountable for their actions, they may engage in unethical behavior and not be held responsible for the harm they cause.\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that Friedman's view can have positive implications for societal ethics, such as:\n\n1. Efficient allocation of resources: By focusing on profit maximization, businesses can allocate resources efficiently and effectively, which can lead to economic growth and development.\n2. Innovation: The pursuit of profit can drive innovation and the development of new products and services that can benefit society.\n3. Job creation: Businesses that focus on profit maximization can create jobs and provide employment opportunities for people.\n\nIn conclusion, while Friedman's view that the sole responsibility of business is to increase its profits has some valid points, it is not without its limitations and criticisms. A more nuanced view that balances the need for profit with social and environmental responsibility may be a more effective way to achieve societal ethics."}
{"prompt_new": "What, according to Milton Friedman, is the single duty of business, while also analyzing its impact on societal ethics and noting one potential consequence on community relations?", "result": ", I'd be happy to help!\n\nMilton Friedman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, famously argued that the single duty of business is to maximize profits. In his 1970 article \"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Its Profits,\" Friedman contended that businesses should focus on their core mission of creating value for shareholders, rather than pursuing social or philanthropic goals. He believed that this approach would ultimately benefit society as a whole, as businesses would be more efficient and productive.\n\nFrom a societal ethics perspective, Friedman's view has been criticized for being overly narrow and short-sighted. Some argue that businesses have a responsibility to consider the broader social and environmental impacts of their actions, beyond just maximizing profits. This could include things like environmental sustainability, fair labor practices, and community development.\n\nOne potential consequence of Friedman's view on community relations is that it can lead to a lack of trust and mistrust between businesses and the communities they operate in. If businesses are solely focused on profits, they may not invest in community development or address social issues, leading to feelings of neglect and exploitation among community members. This can lead to community resistance and protests, which can ultimately harm the business's reputation and bottom line.\n\nFor example, if a company prioritizes profits over environmental concerns, it may lead to environmental degradation, which can harm the local community's health and quality of life. This could lead to community protests and boycotts, which could damage the company's reputation and ultimately impact its bottom line.\n\nIn contrast, if businesses take a more holistic approach, considering both financial and social responsibilities, they may build trust and goodwill with the community, leading to long-term success and sustainability.\n\nOverall, while Friedman's view on the single duty of business may have been influential, it is essential to consider the broader social and ethical implications of business actions and strive for a more nuanced approach that balances financial goals with social and environmental responsibilities."}
{"prompt_new": "What, in the view of Milton Friedman, constitutes the primary responsibility of a business? Additionally, evaluate its influence on societal ethics and highlight one possible repercussion on community relations, incorporating one relevant case study for context.", "result": ", I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nMilton Friedman, a renowned economist, believed that the primary responsibility of a business is to maximize profits for its shareholders. According to his view, businesses are not responsible for addressing social or environmental issues, as their primary goal is to create value for their owners. This concept is often referred to as the \"shareholder wealth maximization\" theory.\n\nFriedman's perspective has had a significant influence on societal ethics, particularly in the realm of corporate social responsibility (CSR). His ideas have led to a focus on the financial performance of businesses, often at the expense of social and environmental concerns. This has resulted in a tendency for companies to prioritize profits over people and the planet.\n\nOne possible repercussion of this approach is the erosion of community relations. When businesses prioritize profits over social responsibility, they may neglect the needs and concerns of local communities. This can lead to negative consequences, such as:\n\nCase Study: The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) controversy\n\nIn 2016, the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) project sparked widespread controversy when it was discovered that the pipeline was being built near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. The pipeline was intended to transport crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois, but the project was met with fierce opposition from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other Native American communities.\n\nThe controversy highlighted the tension between corporate interests and community concerns. The pipeline's construction was seen as a threat to the tribe's water supply and cultural heritage, while the company, Energy Transfer Partners, emphasized the economic benefits of the project. The conflict ultimately led to a months-long standoff between protesters and law enforcement, with many calling for the pipeline's cancellation.\n\nIn this case, the prioritization of profits over community concerns led to a breakdown in community relations and a significant loss of trust between the company and the affected communities.\n\nIn conclusion, Milton Friedman's view that the primary responsibility of a business is to maximize profits has had a profound influence on societal ethics and community relations. While this approach may lead to short-term gains, it often neglects the long-term social and environmental consequences. As businesses continue to operate in an increasingly interconnected world, it is essential to recognize the importance of balancing profits with social and environmental responsibility."}
{"prompt_new": "What, according to Milton Friedman, is the main duty of a business? Furthermore, assess its impact on societal ethics and pinpoint one potential consequence on community relations, ensuring to substantiate your answer with one pertinent case study and its implications.", "result": "- The main duty of a business, according to Milton Friedman, is to maximize profits for its shareholders. He argued that this is the primary goal of a business, as it aligns with the principles of capitalism and the concept of the \"invisible hand.\" Friedman believed that when businesses focus on maximizing profits, they will naturally create social and economic benefits for society as a whole.\n\nImpact on societal ethics:\n\nFriedman's view on the main duty of a business has been criticized for its focus on profits over social responsibility. Some argue that this approach can lead to a lack of consideration for the ethical implications of business decisions, as well as the potential harm caused to the environment, employees, and the community.\n\nPotential consequence on community relations:\n\nOne potential consequence of this approach is the erosion of community trust and relationships. When businesses prioritize profits over social responsibility, they may engage in practices that harm the community, such as polluting the environment, exploiting workers, or prioritizing profits over safety. This can lead to community distrust and resentment towards businesses, which can have long-term consequences for their reputation and ultimately, their bottom line.\n\nCase study:\n\nThe case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 is a prime example of the consequences of prioritizing profits over social responsibility. The oil tanker, owned by Exxon, spilled millions of gallons of oil into the pristine waters of Alaska, causing widespread environmental damage and harm to local communities. The company's focus on maximizing profits led to a lack of safety measures and inadequate maintenance, which contributed to the disaster. The incident led to a significant loss of public trust and a decline in Exxon's reputation, resulting in long-term damage to the company's brand and bottom line.\n\nImplications:\n\nThe Exxon Valdez case study highlights the importance of considering social responsibility and ethical implications in business decision-making. The incident led to significant changes in the oil industry's safety regulations and practices, as well as increased public awareness of the importance of environmental protection. The case also underscores the importance of building trust with the community and prioritizing social responsibility alongside profits."}

If businesses are solely focused on maximizing profits, they may be more likely to engage in unethical practices, such as environmental degradation or exploitation of workers, as long as they can get away with it. This can erode trust in business and undermine social cohesion.\n\nA relevant case study that illustrates the potential negative consequences of Friedman's view is the Enron scandal. Enron, an energy company, engaged in accounting fraud and hid its financial troubles from investors and the public. The company's focus on maximizing profits led to a collapse of the company and the loss of thousands of jobs. The scandal led to a loss of public trust in the business community and the passage of stricter regulations to prevent similar scandals in the future.\n\nAccording to a study by the Edelman Trust Barometer, a survey of over 33,000 people in 28 countries, the majority of people believe that businesses have a responsibility to address social and environmental issues. The study found that 70% of respondents believe that businesses have a responsibility to address social issues, and 64% believe that businesses have a responsibility to address environmental issues. This suggests that the public expects businesses to play a more active role in addressing social and environmental issues, and that Friedman's view of business as solely focused on profit maximization is not widely accepted.\n\nIn conclusion, while Milton Friedman's view of business as solely focused on profit maximization has some validity, it has also been criticized for its potential negative impact on ethical standards in society. The Enron scandal is a prime example of the potential consequences of prioritizing profits over people and the environment. The public expects businesses to play a more active role in addressing social and environmental issues, and businesses that fail to do so may face reputational damage and financial consequences."}

According to a recent article by the Financial Times, \"Carbon capture and storage: The climate solution that's getting a boost\" (published on October 12, 2021), DAC is a costly technology that requires significant upfront investment.\n\nThe article states: \"Direct air capture (DAC) is a process that involves capturing carbon dioxide directly from the air, rather than from industrial sources, such as power plants and cement factories. The technology is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to play a crucial role in reducing global carbon emissions. However, it is also a costly and energy-intensive process, requiring significant upfront investment.\"\n\nThe article highlights that the cost of DAC is estimated to be around $100-150 per ton of CO2 captured, which is significantly higher than the cost of carbon capture from industrial sources. However, the article also notes that the cost is expected to decrease as the technology improves and economies of scale are achieved.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Nature, \"Global potential of direct air capture for carbon removal\" (published on September 22, 2021), estimates that the cost of DAC could decrease to around $50-100 per ton of CO2 captured by 2050, making it more viable as a carbon removal strategy.\n\nIn summary, while DAC is a substantial financial investment, the technology has the potential to play a crucial role in reducing global carbon emissions, and the cost is expected to decrease over time as the technology improves and economies of scale are achieved.\n\nSource:\n\n* \"Carbon capture and storage: The climate solution that's getting a boost\" by Helen Armstrong, Financial Times, October 12, 2021\n* \"Global potential of direct air capture for carbon removal\" by Sabine Fuss et al., Nature, September 22, 2021"}

{"prompt_new": "How might solid US economic data from the past quarter affect the Fed's decision on interest rates?", "result": "://\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to announce its decision on interest rates at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on December 13-14. The decision will be based on various economic indicators, including the latest data on the US economy. Here's how solid US economic data from the past quarter might affect the Fed's decision on interest rates:\n\n1. **GDP growth**: A stronger-than-expected GDP growth rate could indicate a robust economy, which might lead the Fed to maintain its current interest rate or even consider a rate hike. On the other hand, a weaker-than-expected growth rate could prompt the Fed to delay rate hikes or maintain the current rate.\n2. **Inflation**: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation rates will be closely watched. If inflation remains within the Fed's 2% target range, it could support a rate hike. However, if inflation is higher than expected, the Fed might delay rate hikes to avoid over-tightening the economy.\n3. **Job market**: Strong job market data, such as a low unemployment rate and steady wage growth, could indicate a strong labor market, which might lead the Fed to raise interest rates. On the other hand, a weaker job market could lead the Fed to delay rate hikes.\n4. **Core inflation**: The core PCE index, which excludes food and energy prices, is a key indicator of underlying inflation. If core inflation remains low, it could indicate that the economy is not overheating, and the Fed might be more likely to maintain the current interest rate.\n5. **Housing market**: The housing market has been a concern for the Fed, as it has been experiencing a slowdown. Stronger-than-expected housing data could indicate that the market is stabilizing, which might lead the Fed to maintain the current interest rate. Weak data, on the other hand, could prompt the Fed to delay rate hikes.\n\nIn summary, solid US economic data from the past quarter could lead the Fed to:\n\n* Maintain the current interest rate if the data suggests a robust economy with stable inflation and a strong job market.\n* Consider a rate hike if the data indicates a strong economy with low inflation and a strong job market.\n* Delay rate hikes if the data suggests a weaker economy, high inflation, or a housing market slowdown.\n\nKeep in mind that the Fed's decision will also be influenced by other factors, such as global economic conditions, trade policy, and the outlook for the economy."}

Additionally, consider how inflation rates during this period might influence their decision.", "result": ", I'm happy to help!\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to consider the solid US economic data from the past quarter when making its decision on interest rates. The recent data suggests a strong economy, which could influence the Fed's decision to raise interest rates.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **GDP growth**: The US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.1% in the first quarter, which is a significant increase from the 1.9% growth rate in the previous quarter. A strong GDP growth rate indicates a healthy economy, which could lead to higher interest rates.\n2. **Job market**: The unemployment rate has remained low, at 3.6%, and the number of job openings has increased. A strong labor market can lead to higher interest rates as the Fed aims to keep the economy from overheating.\n3. **Inflation**: The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose by 1.7% in the first quarter. While this is still below the Fed's 2% target, it's higher than the 1.4% growth rate in the previous quarter. The Fed is likely to monitor inflation closely to ensure it remains within its target range.\n4. **Wage growth**: Wage growth has been moderate, with average hourly earnings rising by 3.2% year-over-year. The Fed may consider this a sign of a strong labor market, which could lead to higher interest rates.\n5. **Consumer spending**: Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the US economy, has been strong, with a 2.5% increase in the first quarter. This suggests that the economy is driven by consumer demand, which could support higher interest rates.\n\nConsidering these factors, the Fed may decide to raise interest rates to:\n\n1. **Prevent overheating**: A strong economy and low unemployment rate could lead to higher inflation, which is why the Fed may raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating.\n2. **Maintain inflation target**: The Fed may raise interest rates to ensure that inflation remains within its 2% target. A higher inflation rate could lead to higher interest rates to curb demand and prevent inflation from rising further.\n3. **Sustain economic growth**: The Fed may raise interest rates to sustain economic growth by preventing the economy from growing too quickly. This could help maintain a balanced economy and prevent asset price bubbles.\n\nIn conclusion, the solid US economic data from the past quarter could lead the Fed to raise interest rates to maintain a healthy economy, prevent overheating, and ensure inflation remains within its target range."}

This is crucial for middle-distance runners, who often need to maintain a high intensity over a prolonged period.\n* Time-efficient: HIIT is a time-efficient form of training, allowing professional runners to fit in multiple workouts in a shorter amount of time (3).\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n* Increased risk of injury: HIIT can increase the risk of injury, particularly in the legs and lower back, due to the high-intensity nature of the training (4).\n* Decreased endurance: HIIT may not be suitable for all professional runners, as it can lead to decreased endurance and a higher risk of fatigue (5).\n\nComparison with moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT):\n\n* MICT involves exercising at a moderate intensity for a prolonged period, typically 30-60 minutes. While MICT can improve cardiovascular fitness, it may not be as effective as HIIT for improving anaerobic endurance (6).\n* MICT is often considered a more traditional and conservative approach to training, which may be beneficial for professional runners who prioritize consistency and endurance over high-intensity training.\n\nExamples of professional middle-distance runners who have used HIIT:\n\n* Mo Farah, a British professional runner, has credited HIIT with improving his performance and allowing him to achieve his goals (7).\n* Galen Rupp, an American professional runner, has used HIIT as part of his training program to improve his endurance and speed (8).\n\nIn conclusion, HIIT can be an effective form of training for professional middle-distance runners, particularly for improving cardiovascular fitness and anaerobic endurance. However, it is essential to weigh the benefits against the potential drawbacks, such as the increased risk of injury and decreased endurance. Professional runners should consider their individual needs and goals when deciding whether to incorporate HIIT into their training program.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Billat, L. V. (2003).

{"prompt_new": "The Taliban killed more than 100 members of the Afghan security forces inside a military compound in central Maidan Wardak province on Monday, a senior defense official said.\"We have information that 126 people have been killed in the explosion inside the military training center, eight special commandoes are among the dead,\" said a senior official in the defense ministry in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity.The official said the assault began on Monday morning when the attackers rammed a car full explosives through a military checkpoint and detonated the vehicle inside the campus of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces training center in Maidan Shahr, the capital of Maidan Wardak province.Two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and shot at many Afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes.Defense ministry officials said the Taliban had used U.S.-made armored Humvee vehicles captured from Afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications.A second source residing in Maidan Wardak province said more than 100 members of National Directorate of Security (NDS) were killed in the complex attack.\"I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion,\" the former provincial official said.Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak said he saw bodies of 35 Afghan forces in the hospital.\"Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,\" said Hotak, adding that \"the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the Afghan forces.\"\"The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed,\" he said.Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll.Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces.\"I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul.A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack.Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Maidan Wardak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the Afghan special forces unit.President Ashraf Ghani's office in a statement said the \"enemies of the country\" had carried out an attack against NDS personnel in Maidan Shahr. \"They killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons.\"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan condemned the attack on Monday evening and extended his condolences to Ghani.Meanwhile, the Taliban said it met with U.S. officials in Qatar on Monday, in the latest round of talks between the insurgents and Washington aimed at bringing an end to the 17-year war.The U.S. has not officially commented on the reported meeting, which follows the last confirmed talks between the two parties in the UAE in December.\"Following American acceptance of the agenda of ending the occupation of Afghanistan and preventing Afghanistan from being used against other countries in the future, talks with American representatives took place today in Doha, the capital of Qatar,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.Taliban representatives have met several times with U.S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and \"unilaterally\" adding new subjects.The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U.S. pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington.In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data.Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack.Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul.On Sunday, a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded.The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor's convoy in Mohammad Agha district. The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed.The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months, while Afghan and U.S. troops have increased operations against the militants' field commanders.Military sources say around 35 members of the country's security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes.This is while the U.S. is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan.

Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street.

{"prompt_new": "On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences.

{"prompt_new": "Israel plays down fears of war with Syria . Colleen Siegel JERUSALEM 1996-08-22 Israel 's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup . Itamar Rabinovich , who as Israel 's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria , told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight . \" It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate . The Syrians are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , \" he said . Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador . He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar , a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician . Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message , via Washington , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions . But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere . Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile . It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes . \" The message that we sent to ( Syrian President Hafez al- ) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , \" Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview . Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war . Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government 's willingness to make Golan concessions .
