He slowly sat up, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar surroundings. He was in a strange room, with a worn-out couch, a coffee table littered with empty beer cans, and a TV blaring some inane sitcom.\n\nAs he tried to piece together the events of the previous night, a faint memory crept into his mind. He had been at a bar with friends, celebrating a promotion at work. They had been drinking, laughing, and having a great time. But something had gone wrong. He couldn't quite recall what, but he knew it wasn't good.\n\nJohn stumbled out of the room, his legs wobbly, and made his way to the kitchen. He opened the fridge, hoping to find some water or aspirin to ease his throbbing head. Instead, he spotted a nearly empty vodka bottle, its label torn and crumpled on the counter.\n\nAh, yes. He remembered now. He had found the vodka on the street, abandoned and forgotten. He had brought it home, thinking it would be a good way to forget his troubles. And forget, he had. Big time.\n\nJohn took a long swig of the vodka, feeling the burn as it went down his throat. He closed his eyes, letting the liquid numbness spread through his body. He didn't want to think about the events of the previous night. He didn't want to think about anything.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, John's memories began to fade, replaced by a dull, fuzzy haze. He stumbled back to the couch, collapsing onto it with a groan. He closed his eyes, letting the vodka do its magic.\n\nWhen he finally came to, it was morning. The TV was still blaring, but the room was quiet and still. John slowly sat up, his head throbbing in protest. He looked around, taking in the mess of the room. He had lost the night, and he had found a bottle of vodka. And he had drunk to forget."}

{"prompt_new": "Summarize the below text using one sentence within 20 words. The summary should begin with the word 'We', and must contain the word 'activations'. The word 'transformer' must not appear in the summary.\n\nWe analyze the storage and recall of factual associations in autoregressive transformer language models, finding evidence that these associations correspond to localized, directly-editable computations. We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME).  We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing. The code, dataset, visualizations, and an interactive demo notebook are available in the supplemental materials.", "result": "I'd be happy to help!
