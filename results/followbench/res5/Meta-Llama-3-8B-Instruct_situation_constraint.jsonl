How much did she earn in total?", "result": "Let's break it down:\n\n* On Friday, Weng babysat for 50 minutes, which is 0.83 hours (50 minutes / 60). Since it's a workday, she earns $12 per hour, so she earned 0.83 * 12 = $10.\n* On Saturday morning, Weng babysat for 1.5 hours, and since it's a weekend, she earns $16 per hour. So she earned 1.5 * 16 = $24.\n* On Saturday afternoon, Weng babysat for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. Since it's a weekend, she earns $16 per hour, so she earned 0.5 * 16 = $8.\n* Unfortunately, Weng had to compensate her employer $5 for breaking a cup.\n\nTo find her total earnings, we add up the earnings from each session: $10 + $24 + $8 = $42. Then, we subtract the $5 compensation: $42 - $5 = $37.\n\nWeng earned a total of $37."}

Then, it creates a new list containing only the elements that have a frequency of 1. Finally, it sorts this list in ascending order and returns it.\n\nFor example, if you call `unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])`, it will return `[0, 2, 9, 123]`, which are the elements that appear only once in the original list, sorted in ascending order."}

The `rows` and `cols` variables store the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively. The `data` variable is a 2D vector that stores the actual matrix data.\n\nThe class has a constructor that initializes the matrix with the given number of rows and columns, and sets all elements to 0.\n\nThe class also has getter and setter methods for the number of rows, number of columns, and matrix data. The `getRows` and `getCols` methods return the number of rows and columns, respectively. The `getData` method returns a reference to the 2D vector that stores the matrix data. The `setData` method sets the matrix data.\n\nThe class overloads the `<<` operator to print the matrix.
