These HTML files are rendered by routes defined in 'app.py'.\n   - Constraint 3: Within 'ShopApp', there's a folder called 'STATIC' housing various static files like CSS styles and JavaScript scripts. One of these CSS files, named 'styles.css', is heavily used across all the HTML files in the 'VIEWS' directory to style the web pages.\n   - Constraint 4: To facilitate database operations, 'app.py' employs a module named 'db_ops.py' which resides in the main 'ShopApp' directory. This module contains functions like 'add_product' and 'get_user_details'.\n   - Constraint 5: The 'user.py' has a dependency on an external library named 'bcrypt' to hash and verify user passwords.\n\n2) Discrimination of whether the answer satisfies each constraint:\n   - Constraint 1: YES (The answer correctly describes the contents of the 'MODELS' directory and the classes defined within the files.)\n   - Constraint 2: YES (The answer accurately mentions the 'VIEWS' directory and the HTML files it contains, along with their rendering by routes in 'app.py'.)\n   - Constraint 3: YES (The answer includes the 'STATIC' directory and mentions the 'styles.css' file used in the HTML files.)\n   - Constraint 4: YES (The answer states that 'app.py' employs the 'db_ops.py' module for database operations and lists the functions it contains.)\n   - Constraint 5: YES (The answer notes that 'user.py' has a dependency on the 'bcrypt' library for password handling.)\n\n3) Final output:\n```python\n['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']\n```"}}]}

You can use a piece of paper that's slightly larger than the book's dimensions to ensure a snug fit.\n\n**Step 3: Cut the Wrapping Paper**\n\nCut the wrapping paper to the desired size, leaving a little extra on each side for tucking and folding. You can use a ruler or a cutting mat to ensure a straight cut.\n\n**Step 4: Place the Gift on the Paper**\n\nPosition the book in the center of the wrapping paper, ensuring it's aligned with the edges of the paper.\n\n**Step 5: Fold and Tuck the Paper**\n\nFold one edge of the paper over the book and tuck it under the book, creating a crisp crease. Repeat this process for the other three edges, making sure to create a neat and symmetrical fold.\n\n**Step 6: Secure with Tape**\n\nUse gift wrapping tape to secure the paper in place, applying gentle pressure to ensure the paper doesn't crease or wrinkle. You can also use tape to create a decorative border around the edges of the paper.\n\n**Step 7: Add a Gift Tag or Card**\n\nAttach a gift tag or card to the gift with a ribbon or a piece of twine. You can write a personal message or the birthday person's name on the tag.\n\n**Step 8: Add Embellishments (Optional)**\n\nIf you want to add a touch of extra flair, you can use ribbon, bows, or gift embellishments to decorate the gift. Make sure they're securely attached to the gift wrapping paper.\n\n**Step 9: Final Touches**\n\nGive the gift a final once-over to ensure everything is secure and even. Fluff out any wrinkles or creases, and you're done!\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* To add an extra layer of protection to the book, you can wrap it in a soft cloth or tissue paper before wrapping it in the gift wrapping paper.\n* Consider using a gift box or a book-shaped gift box to add an extra layer of protection and make the gift more special.\n* If you're short on time, you can use a pre-made gift wrapping paper with a design that matches the theme or the friend's favorite colors.\n* Don't forget to include a personalized note or card with a heartfelt message to make the gift even more special.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create a beautifully wrapped gift that your friend will appreciate and cherish. Happy wrapping, and I hope your friend has a wonderful birthday!\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 4 added constraints.\n2) For the 4 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 4 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 4 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 4 added constraints are:\n   - The gift is for a themed surprise birthday party for a close friend.\n   - The gift chosen is a book.\n   - The wrapping should ensure the present looks both attractive and thoughtful.\n   - The response should carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios.\n\n2) Discrimination of whether the answer satisfies each constraint:\n   - The gift is for a themed surprise birthday party for a close friend: **YES** (The answer mentions a themed surprise birthday party.)\n   - The gift chosen is a book: **YES** (The answer specifies that the gift is a book.)\n   - The wrapping should ensure the present looks both attractive and thoughtful: **YES** (The answer provides detailed steps to make the wrapping attractive and thoughtful.)\n   - The response should carefully consider all the above mentioned scenarios: **YES** (The answer addresses all the constraints mentioned.)\n\n3) Final output:\n```python\n['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']\n```"}}]}

We also have a `data` vector to store the matrix elements.\n*   The constructor `Matrix(int rows, int cols)` initializes the matrix with the given number of rows and columns, and sets all elements to zero.\n*   The `operator()` function is overloaded to allow access to individual elements of the matrix using the row and column indices. It checks if the indices are within the bounds of the matrix and throws an `std::out_of_range` exception if they are not.\n*   The `operator()` function returns a reference to the element at the specified row and column. If the indices are within bounds, it returns a reference to the corresponding element in the `data` vector. If the indices are out of bounds, it throws an `std::out_of_range` exception.\n\nYou can use the `Matrix` class as follows:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    Matrix m(3, 4);\n\n    // Accessing elements\n    m(0, 0) = 1;  // Sets the element at row 0, column 0 to 1\n    std::cout << m(0, 0) << std::endl;  // Outputs: 1\n\n    // Trying to access an out-of-bounds element\n    try {\n        m(3, 4) = 5;  // Throws an std::out_of_range exception\n    } catch (const std::out_of_range& e) {\n        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a 3x4 matrix `m` and access its elements using the `operator()` function. We also try to access an out-of-bounds element, which throws an `std::out_of_range` exception.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 3 added constraints.\n2) For the 3 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 3 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 3 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 3 added constraints are:\n   - The class should have a constructor that takes the number of rows and columns as arguments and initializes the matrix with zeros.\n   - Implement the operator() method that allows access to individual elements of the matrix using the row and column indices.

It performs bounds checking and throws an `std::out_of_range` exception if the indices are out of bounds.\n*   The `operator+` method performs matrix addition. It takes another `Matrix` as an argument and returns a new `Matrix` with the sum of the two matrices. If the dimensions of the matrices do not match, it throws an `std::invalid_argument` exception.\n*   The `print` method prints the matrix to the standard output, displaying the elements row by row.\n\nYou can use the `Matrix` class as follows:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    Matrix m1(3, 3);\n    m1(0, 0) = 1;\n    m1(0, 1) = 2;\n    m1(0, 2) = 3;\n    m1(1, 0) = 4;\n    m1(1, 1) = 5;\n    m1(1, 2) = 6;\n    m1(2, 0) = 7;\n    m1(2, 1) = 8;\n    m1(2, 2) = 9;\n\n    Matrix m2(3, 3);\n    m2(0, 0) = 10;\n    m2(0, 1) = 11;\n    m2(0, 2) = 12;\n    m2(1, 0) = 13;\n    m2(1, 1) = 14;\n    m2(1, 2) = 15;\n    m2(2, 0) = 16;\n    m2(2, 1) = 17;\n    m2(2, 2) = 18;\n\n    Matrix result = m1 + m2;\n    result.print();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates two matrices `m1` and `m2` and adds them using the `operator+` method. The result is printed to the console using the `print` method.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 5 added constraints.\n2) For the 5 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 5 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 5 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 5 added constraints are:\n   - The class should have a constructor that takes the number of rows and columns as arguments and initializes the matrix with zeros.\n   - Implement the operator() method that allows access to individual elements of the matrix using the row and column indices.
