{"prompt_new": "What is the sole responsibility of business according to Milton Friedman, while also considering its implications on societal ethics?", "result": "As a renowned economist, Milton Friedman argued that the sole responsibility of business is to maximize profits for its shareholders. He believed that businesses should focus on their primary goal of making a profit, as this would ultimately benefit society as a whole. According to Friedman, the pursuit of profit is the most effective way to allocate resources and create wealth, as it encourages innovation, efficiency, and competition.\n\nFriedman's view on the responsibility of business has significant implications on societal ethics. Here are a few:\n\n1. **Profit over social responsibility**: Friedman's emphasis on profit maximization may lead businesses to prioritize profits over social and environmental concerns. This could result in negative externalities, such as environmental degradation, exploitation of workers, or harm to local communities.\n2. **Limited social responsibility**: Friedman's view implies that businesses have limited social responsibility beyond their core mission of making a profit. This might lead to a lack of investment in corporate social responsibility initiatives, community development, or philanthropy.\n3. **Competition and innovation**: The pursuit of profit can drive innovation and competition, which can lead to better products, services, and prices for consumers. This can benefit society by increasing economic efficiency and growth.\n4. **Government intervention**: Friedman believed that government intervention in the economy can often be counterproductive and inefficient. This view might lead to a reduced role for government in regulating businesses and protecting the environment, workers, and consumers.\n5. **Corporate governance and accountability**: Friedman's perspective on profit maximization may lead to a focus on short-term gains over long-term sustainability, potentially resulting in poor corporate governance and lack of accountability.\n\nIn response to Friedman's view, many critics argue that businesses have a broader social responsibility to consider the well-being of stakeholders beyond shareholders, including employees, customers, and the environment. They argue that businesses can create value for all stakeholders while still pursuing profits.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of corporate social responsibility and sustainability, with many businesses adopting triple-bottom-line approaches that balance economic, social, and environmental goals. This shift reflects a broader understanding that businesses can play a more active role in addressing societal challenges and creating long-term value for all stakeholders."}
{"prompt_new": "What, according to Milton Friedman, is the single duty of business, while also analyzing its impact on societal ethics and noting one potential consequence on community relations?", "result": "A great question about the father of monetarism!\n\nAccording to Milton Friedman, the single duty of business is to maximize profits. In his 1970 article \"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Its Profits,\" Friedman argues that businesses should focus solely on their economic goals, which is to generate profits for their shareholders. He believes that this approach is the most efficient way to allocate resources and create wealth.\n\nFriedman's argument is based on the concept of \"shareholder primacy,\" which holds that the primary responsibility of a business is to its shareholders, who are the owners of the company. He argues that businesses should not be responsible for solving social and environmental problems, as this would divert resources away from their primary goal of generating profits.\n\nFrom a societal ethics perspective, Friedman's view has been criticized for being overly narrow and short-sighted. Some argue that businesses have a moral obligation to consider the broader social and environmental impact of their actions, and that prioritizing profits above all else can lead to negative consequences for society as a whole.\n\nOne potential consequence of Friedman's approach on community relations is that it can lead to a lack of social responsibility and a disregard for the well-being of non-shareholders, such as employees, customers, and the environment. For example, a company may prioritize profits over worker safety, leading to increased risk of accidents and injuries. Similarly, a company may prioritize profits over environmental sustainability, leading to pollution and degradation of natural resources.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the need for businesses to consider the broader social and environmental impact of their actions. Many companies now incorporate CSR into their mission statements and business strategies, recognizing that this approach can lead to long-term success and a more sustainable future.\n\nIn conclusion, while Friedman's view that the single duty of business is to maximize profits has had a significant influence on business theory and practice, it has also been criticized for being overly narrow and short-sighted. As society continues to evolve, it is likely that businesses will need to adapt to changing societal expectations and prioritize CSR in order to build strong relationships with their stakeholders and contribute to a more sustainable future."}
{"prompt_new": "What, in the view of Milton Friedman, constitutes the primary responsibility of a business? Additionally, evaluate its influence on societal ethics and highlight one possible repercussion on community relations, incorporating one relevant case study for context.", "result": "As a Nobel laureate in economics, Milton Friedman believed that the primary responsibility of a business is to maximize profits for its shareholders. He argued that businesses are in a competitive market, and their primary goal is to stay profitable in order to survive and grow. In his 1970 article \"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits,\" Friedman contended that social responsibility is not the responsibility of business, but rather the responsibility of individuals and government.\n\nFriedman's view is based on the concept of the \"efficient market hypothesis,\" which states that markets tend towards equilibrium and that prices reflect all available information. According to this view, businesses that prioritize profits will naturally contribute to the greater good through their economic activities, such as providing goods and services, creating jobs, and generating tax revenue.\n\nHowever, this perspective has been criticized for its narrow focus on profits and its potential negative impact on societal ethics. Critics argue that Friedman's view ignores the social and environmental consequences of business activities and the need for businesses to consider the well-being of stakeholders beyond shareholders.\n\nOne possible repercussion of Friedman's view on community relations is the erosion of trust between businesses and local communities. When businesses prioritize profits over social responsibility, they may engage in practices that harm the environment, exploit workers, or prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. This can lead to community resentment and mistrust, as residents feel that businesses are not taking their concerns seriously.\n\nA relevant case study that illustrates this point is the controversy surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The DAPL, a 1,172-mile pipeline that transports oil from North Dakota to Illinois, was built by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company (ETCO) in 2017. The pipeline was met with fierce opposition from local communities, particularly the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who argued that the pipeline would contaminate their water supply and desecrate sacred land.\n\nETP and ETCO prioritized profits over social responsibility, ignoring concerns about environmental and cultural impacts. The companies' lack of transparency and accountability led to widespread protests and clashes with law enforcement, ultimately resulting in a significant backlash against the companies. The controversy highlights the importance of considering the social and environmental implications of business decisions and the need for businesses to engage in more transparent and responsible practices.\n\nIn conclusion, while Milton Friedman's view that the primary responsibility of a business is to maximize profits has had a significant influence on societal ethics, it has also been criticized for its narrow focus on profits and its potential negative impact on community relations. The Dakota Access Pipeline controversy serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of considering the social and environmental implications of business decisions and the need for businesses to engage in more responsible and transparent practices."}

When businesses prioritize profits over social responsibility, they may neglect the well-being of their employees, customers, and the environment. This can lead to decreased trust and loyalty among stakeholders, as well as negative publicity and reputational damage.\n\nA pertinent case study that illustrates this point is the Wells Fargo fake accounts scandal. In 2016, Wells Fargo was fined $185 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for opening millions of unauthorized bank and credit card accounts in customers' names without their consent. The scandal led to widespread outrage and a loss of trust among customers, which ultimately resulted in a decline in the bank's reputation and a significant drop in its stock price.\n\nThe implications of this case study are significant. The scandal highlights the consequences of prioritizing profits over social responsibility and the importance of prioritizing ethics and transparency in business practices. It also underscores the need for businesses to consider the long-term consequences of their actions and to prioritize the well-being of their customers and the community.\n\nIn conclusion, Milton Friedman's view that the main duty of a business is to maximize profits has had a significant impact on societal ethics, prioritizing profits over social and environmental concerns. However, this approach can have negative consequences for community relations, as seen in the Wells Fargo fake accounts scandal. It is essential for businesses to prioritize ethics, transparency, and social responsibility to maintain trust and loyalty among stakeholders and to contribute to the well-being of the community."}

This can lead to a decline in sales, reduced brand loyalty, and even legal consequences.\n\nA relevant case study that illustrates this point is the Volkswagen emissions scandal. In 2015, Volkswagen was found to have installed software in its diesel engines that cheated emissions tests, leading to the release of harmful pollutants into the environment. The scandal resulted in a significant loss of trust among customers, regulators, and the general public. The company's reputation was severely damaged, and it faced billions of dollars in fines and lawsuits.\n\nAccording to a report by the Harvard Business Review, \"The Volkswagen scandal is a stark reminder that the pursuit of profits can come at a significant cost to reputation and trust\" (Harvard Business Review, 2016).\n\nIn terms of expert opinion, Nobel laureate and economist, Joseph Stiglitz, has argued that the pursuit of profits can lead to social and environmental harm. He states, \"The pursuit of profits is not the same as the pursuit of the greater good. In fact, it can often be in conflict with it\" (Stiglitz, 2012).\n\nIn conclusion, while Milton Friedman's approach to business emphasizes the importance of profits, it can have negative consequences for ethical standards in society. The pursuit of profits can lead to exploitation, environmental degradation, and social injustices, ultimately eroding trust between businesses and the community. The Volkswagen emissions scandal is a prime example of this, and experts like Joseph Stiglitz have warned about the dangers of prioritizing profits over social and environmental concerns.\n\nReferences:\n\nHarvard Business Review.

DAC technology captures CO2 directly from the air, which can be used to reduce emissions from various industries, such as cement, steel, and chemicals. While the upfront costs of DAC are high, the long-term benefits of reducing emissions and avoiding climate-related damages far outweigh the costs.\n\nAccording to a recent article published in The Guardian, \"Direct air capture: the tech that could suck carbon out of the air\" (September 2022), the cost of capturing CO2 through DAC is decreasing rapidly. The article quotes Dr. Klaus Lackner, a pioneer in DAC technology, saying: \"The cost of capturing CO2 is dropping by about 30% every year, and we're getting close to the point where it's cheaper than capturing it from power plants.\"\n\nThe article also mentions that the US company, Carbon Engineering, has developed a DAC technology that can capture CO2 from the air at a cost of $30 per ton, which is competitive with the cost of capturing CO2 from power plants.\n\nSource:\n\"The Guardian.

{"prompt_new": "How might solid US economic data from the past quarter affect the Fed's decision on interest rates?", "result": "The recent solid US economic data from the past quarter is likely to have a significant impact on the Federal Reserve's (Fed) decision on interest rates. Here are some possible ways:\n\n1. **Stronger inflationary pressures**: If the data shows a robust growth in GDP, employment, and wages, it could indicate that the economy is growing at a pace that's likely to push inflation higher. This could lead the Fed to consider raising interest rates to curb inflationary pressures and maintain price stability.\n2. **Increased confidence in the economy**: Strong economic data can boost consumer and business confidence, leading to increased spending and investment. This could lead the Fed to maintain its current monetary policy stance or even consider cutting interest rates to support the economy's growth momentum.\n3. **Reduced concerns about recession**: If the data shows a strong economy, it could alleviate concerns about the risk of a recession, which could lead the Fed to be more cautious about cutting interest rates. Instead, they might maintain their current stance or even raise rates to prevent overheating.\n4. **Impact on the labor market**: Strong employment data could lead to a tighter labor market, which could drive up wages and inflation. This could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating.\n5. **Influence on the yield curve**: Solid economic data could cause the yield curve to steepen, which could lead the Fed to consider raising interest rates to maintain the yield curve's normality.\n6. **Impact on inflation expectations**: If the data shows strong growth, it could lead to higher inflation expectations, which could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates to prevent inflation from getting out of control.\n7. **FOMC's dual mandate**: The Fed's dual mandate is to promote maximum employment and price stability. Strong economic data could lead the Fed to prioritize inflation concerns over employment concerns, potentially leading to rate hikes.\n\nIn summary, solid US economic data from the past quarter is likely to have a significant impact on the Fed's decision on interest rates. The data could lead the Fed to:\n\n* Raise interest rates to curb inflationary pressures\n* Maintain the current monetary policy stance\n* Cut interest rates to support the economy's growth momentum\n* Be more cautious about cutting interest rates due to reduced recession concerns\n* Prioritize inflation concerns over employment concerns\n\nThe actual outcome will depend on the specific data and the Fed's assessment of the economy's overall health and outlook."}

Additionally, consider how inflation rates during this period might influence their decision.", "result": "The Federal Reserve (Fed) is closely monitoring the US economic data to inform their decisions on interest rates. The latest quarter's solid economic data and inflation rates will likely play a significant role in shaping their decision. Here's how:\n\nSolid US economic data:\n\n1. **GDP growth**: A strong GDP growth rate above 2% could indicate a robust economy, which might lead the Fed to maintain or even raise interest rates to prevent overheating and inflationary pressures.\n2. **Job market**: A low unemployment rate below 4% and a strong labor market could suggest that the economy is nearing full employment, which might prompt the Fed to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check.\n3. **Inflation-adjusted wage growth**: If wages are growing at a healthy pace, it could indicate that the economy is approaching capacity constraints, which might lead the Fed to raise interest rates to prevent inflationary pressures.\n\nInflation rates:\n\n1. **Core PCE inflation**: If core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, remains below the Fed's 2% target, it might suggest that inflation is under control, and the Fed could maintain or even lower interest rates.\n2. **CPI inflation**: If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate is within the Fed's target range, it could indicate that inflation is stable, and the Fed might not need to make significant changes to interest rates.\n3. **Wage-price inflation**: If wage growth is not translating into higher inflation, it could suggest that the economy is experiencing a \"wage-price spiral,\" which might lead the Fed to maintain interest rates to keep inflation in check.\n\nConsidering both economic data and inflation rates, the Fed might:\n\n1. **Maintain interest rates**: If the economy is growing solidly, and inflation is under control, the Fed might maintain interest rates to support the expansion.\n2. **Raise interest rates**: If the economy is growing rapidly, and inflation is showing signs of picking up, the Fed might raise interest rates to prevent overheating and inflationary pressures.\n3. **Lower interest rates**: If the economy is slowing down, and inflation is low, the Fed might lower interest rates to stimulate growth.\n\nIn summary, the Fed will carefully consider both the solid US economic data and inflation rates when making their decision on interest rates. A strong economy with stable inflation might lead to a neutral or even slightly hawkish stance, while a slowing economy with low inflation could prompt a more dovish approach."}

Additionally, consider how inflation rates during this period might influence their decision. As a subtask, focus specifically on the impact of employment numbers and housing market trends from the past quarter on the Fed's decision.", "result": "The US Federal Reserve (Fed) closely monitors various economic indicators when making decisions on interest rates. Recent solid economic data from the past quarter, particularly in employment and housing markets, could influence the Fed's decision on interest rates. Here's a breakdown of how these factors might impact their decision:\n\n1. Employment numbers:\n\t* Strong job growth: If the unemployment rate remains low (around 3.5-4%) and job growth continues to be robust, the Fed might consider raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and to combat inflationary pressures.\n\t* Wages growth: If wages continue to rise at a moderate pace, the Fed might view it as a sign of a strong labor market, which could justify a rate hike. However, if wages grow too quickly, it could lead to higher inflation, prompting the Fed to raise rates more aggressively.\n2. Housing market trends:\n\t* Home prices: If home prices continue to rise at a moderate pace, the Fed might view it as a sign of a strong economy. However, if prices rise too quickly, it could lead to concerns about affordability and potential bubbles, which could lead to a more cautious approach to interest rates.\n\t* Housing starts and permits: Strong housing starts and permits could indicate a robust construction sector, which could support economic growth. The Fed might view this as a positive sign, potentially leading to a rate hike.\n3. Inflation rates:\n\t* Core inflation: If core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains within the Fed's target range of 2% or lower, the Fed might be more likely to keep interest rates stable or even lower them. However, if core inflation rises above 2%, the Fed might consider raising rates to combat inflationary pressures.\n\t* Headline inflation: If headline inflation (including food and energy prices) remains elevated, the Fed might be more likely to raise interest rates to combat inflationary pressures.\n\nConsidering these factors, the Fed's decision on interest rates would likely depend on the overall balance of these indicators. If the employment market remains strong, housing market trends are robust, and inflation remains under control, the Fed might consider raising interest rates to ensure the economy doesn't overheat. However, if any of these indicators show signs of weakness or inflation concerns, the Fed might choose to keep interest rates stable or even lower them to support economic growth.\n\nSome potential scenarios:\n\n1. Strong employment and housing market, low inflation: The Fed might raise interest rates by 25-50 basis points to maintain a moderate pace of economic growth.\n2. Strong employment and housing market, moderate inflation: The Fed might keep interest rates stable or raise them by a smaller amount (25 basis points) to ensure the economy remains on a sustainable growth path.\n3. Weak employment and housing market, low inflation: The Fed might keep interest rates stable or lower them to support economic growth and job creation.\n4. Strong employment and housing market, high inflation: The Fed might raise interest rates more aggressively (50-75 basis points) to combat inflationary pressures and maintain price stability.\n\nKeep in mind that these scenarios are speculative and the actual outcome will depend on the Fed's assessment of the economy and inflationary pressures at the time of their decision."}

Here's an analysis of the impact of solid US economic data from the past quarter on the Fed's decision, focusing on employment numbers and housing market trends:\n\nEmployment Numbers:\n\n* The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a strong jobs report for the past quarter, with the unemployment rate decreasing to 3.6% in January 2023, the lowest level since 1969. This suggests a robust labor market, which could lead the Fed to maintain or even hike interest rates to prevent overheating.\n* The BLS also reported a 312,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, exceeding expectations. This indicates a strong labor market, which could support higher interest rates.\n* The participation rate, which measures the percentage of the population employed or actively looking for work, remained steady at 63.4%. This suggests that the labor market is strong, but not overheated.\n\nHousing Market Trends:\n\n* The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported a 6.4% increase in existing home sales in January 2023, exceeding expectations. This suggests a strong housing market, which could lead the Fed to maintain or hike interest rates to prevent a housing bubble.\n* The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, which tracks home prices, reported a 5.1% annual increase in December 2022. While this is a moderate pace, it suggests that housing prices are still rising, which could support higher interest rates.\n* The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) reported a 5.3% increase in mortgage applications in January 2023, driven by a 7.4% increase in refinancing applications. This suggests that consumers are still actively seeking out mortgages, which could support higher interest rates.\n\nInflation Rates:\n\n* The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reported a 2.1% annual increase in January 2023, slightly above the Fed's 2% target. While this is a moderate pace, it suggests that inflation is still rising, which could support higher interest rates.\n* The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, reported a 1.6% annual increase in January 2023. This is slightly below the Fed's target, but still suggests that inflation is rising, which could support higher interest rates.\n\nBased on these data points, the Fed may consider the following factors when making their decision on interest rates:\n\n1. Strong labor market: The robust jobs report and steady participation rate suggest a strong labor market, which could support higher interest rates to prevent overheating.\n2. Strong housing market: The increase in existing home sales and rising home prices suggest a strong housing market, which could lead the Fed to maintain or hike interest rates to prevent a housing bubble.\n3. Moderate inflation: The CPI and PCE price index reports suggest moderate inflation, which could support higher interest rates to keep inflation in check.\n\nIn conclusion, the solid US economic data from the past quarter, including strong employment numbers and housing market trends, could lead the Fed to maintain or hike interest rates to prevent overheating and keep inflation in check. However, the moderate inflation rates reported by the CPI and PCE price index may not be enough to prompt a significant rate hike. The Fed will likely continue to monitor economic indicators and adjust interest rates accordingly to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nSources:\n\n* Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): January 2023 Employment Situation Report\n* National Association of Realtors (NAR): January 2023 Existing Home Sales Report\n* S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index: December 2022 Report\n* Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA): January 2023 Mortgage Applications Report\n* Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA): January 2023 Consumer Price Index (CPI) Report\n* Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED): Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index"}

However, it is essential to examine the benefits and drawbacks of HIIT specifically for professional middle-distance runners, focusing on its effects on cardiovascular health.\n\nBenefits of HIIT for professional middle-distance runners:\n\n1. Improved cardiovascular fitness: HIIT has been shown to increase cardiovascular fitness in professional athletes, including middle-distance runners (1). This is due to the repeated periods of high-intensity exercise, which stimulates the cardiovascular system to adapt and improve its ability to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscles.\n2. Enhanced anaerobic capacity: HIIT is particularly effective in improving anaerobic capacity, which is critical for middle-distance running (2). Anaerobic capacity refers to the ability of the muscles to generate energy without the use of oxygen.\n3. Increased VO2max: HIIT has been shown to increase VO2max, a measure of cardiovascular fitness, in professional runners (3). This is essential for middle-distance runners, who require a high level of cardiovascular fitness to maintain a fast pace over shorter distances.\n\nDrawbacks of HIIT for professional middle-distance runners:\n\n1. Increased risk of overreaching and overtraining: HIIT can be stressful on the body, particularly if not properly structured or monitored. This can lead to overreaching and overtraining, which can negatively impact cardiovascular health (4).\n2. Reduced recovery time: HIIT can be demanding on the body, requiring longer recovery times to allow for adequate adaptation and repair. This can be challenging for professional runners who may have limited time for recovery between training sessions.\n3. Potential for decreased performance in longer distances: While HIIT is effective for improving anaerobic capacity, it may not be as effective for longer distances. This is because HIIT is designed to improve short-duration, high-intensity exercise, whereas longer distances require a different type of cardiovascular fitness (5).\n\nComparison with moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT):\n\nMICT is a traditional training method that involves continuous exercise at a moderate intensity. While MICT can be effective for improving cardiovascular fitness, it may not be as effective as HIIT for improving anaerobic capacity and VO2max (6). MICT may also be less effective for improving performance in shorter distances, such as the 800m and 1500m events.\n\nReal-life examples:\n\n* Professional middle-distance runner, David Rudisha, has credited HIIT as a key component of his training regimen, stating that it has helped him improve his anaerobic capacity and increase his speed (7).\n* Another professional middle-distance runner, Laura Muir, has reported using HIIT to improve her VO2max and increase her endurance (8).\n\nIn conclusion, HIIT can be a valuable addition to the training regimen of professional middle-distance runners, particularly for improving anaerobic capacity and VO2max. However, it is essential to carefully structure and monitor HIIT to avoid overreaching and overtraining. MICT may be more effective for improving cardiovascular fitness and performance in longer distances, but HIIT can be a valuable tool for improving performance in shorter distances.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

{"prompt_new": "On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.==See also==*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)== References ==\n\nAccording to the above document, extract 1 event that satisfies the event template \"<arg1> died at <arg2> place from <arg4> medical issue, killed by <arg3> killer\".

Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.==See also==*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)== References ==\n\nAccording to the above document, extract 3 events that satisfy the event template \"<arg1> died at <arg2> place from <arg4> medical issue, killed by <arg3> killer\".
