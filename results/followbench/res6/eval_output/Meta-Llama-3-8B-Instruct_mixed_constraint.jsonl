Amidst the crowd, a man stood out, his eyes bloodshot and his movements unsteady. He was a man who had lost his way, quite literally and figuratively.\n\nHis name was Jack, and he had been wandering the streets for hours, trying to shake off the memories that haunted him. He had been drinking to forget, and it seemed to be working \u2013 for a while, at least. But the vodka had worn off, leaving him with a pounding headache and a sense of desperation.\n\nAs he stumbled through the crowded sidewalks, Jack's mind wandered back to the events that had led him to this point. He thought about the argument with his girlfriend, the one that had ended with her walking out on him. He thought about the job that had gone sour, the one that had left him feeling empty and unfulfilled. And he thought about the bottle of vodka that had been his constant companion for the past few days.\n\nAs he turned a corner, Jack spotted a small bar tucked away in a quiet alley. The neon sign creaked in the wind, reading \"The Lost Souls' Saloon\". It was the perfect place for a man like him, a place where he could drown his sorrows and forget his troubles.\n\nWith a sigh, Jack pushed open the door and stepped inside. The dim lighting and stale air enveloped him, and he felt a sense of familiarity wash over him. He had been here before, many times. He had lost count of how many times he had come to this place, searching for solace in the bottom of a bottle.\n\nThe bartender, a gruff old man with a kind heart, looked up as Jack stumbled in. \"The usual, Jack?\" he asked, his voice a gentle rumble.\n\nJack nodded, his eyes fixed on the whiskey-stained glass in front of him. \"Yeah,\" he muttered, his voice barely audible over the din of the jukebox.\n\nAs the night wore on, Jack lost himself in the haze of the bar, surrounded by the familiar faces of the lost and the lonely. He drank to forget, and for a little while, it worked. But as the hours ticked by, the memories crept back, and he was left with nothing but the bitter taste of regret and the haunting thought that he was still lost, still searching for a way out of the darkness.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify the 1 added constraint.\n2) Please descriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# satisfies the 1 added constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 1 element ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies the 1 added constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1) The 1 added constraint is: \"write a story that describes a man.\"\n\n2) The #Answer of Initial Instruction + 1 constraint# satisfies the 1 added constraint as it focuses on a man named Jack, detailing his experiences, emotions, and actions throughout the story.\n\n3) ['YES']"}}]}
