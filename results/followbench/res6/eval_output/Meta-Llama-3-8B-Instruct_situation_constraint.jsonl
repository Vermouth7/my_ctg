One of these CSS files, named 'styles.css', is heavily used across all the HTML files in the 'VIEWS' directory to style the web pages.\n   - Constraint 4: To facilitate database operations, 'app.py' employs a module named 'db_ops.py' which resides in the main 'ShopApp' directory. This module contains functions like 'add_product' and 'get_user_details'.\n   - Constraint 5: The 'user.py' has a dependency on an external library named 'bcrypt' to hash and verify user passwords.\n\n2) Discrimination of whether the answer satisfies each constraint:\n   - Constraint 1: YES (The answer correctly describes the contents of the 'MODELS' directory and the classes defined in 'product.py' and 'user.py'.)\n   - Constraint 2: YES (The answer accurately mentions the 'VIEWS' directory and the HTML files it contains, along with their rendering by routes in 'app.py'.)\n   - Constraint 3: YES (The answer includes the 'STATIC' directory and the usage of 'styles.css' in the HTML files.)\n   - Constraint 4: YES (The answer states that 'app.py' uses 'db_ops.py' for database operations and lists the functions it contains.)\n   - Constraint 5: YES (The answer notes that 'user.py' has a dependency on the 'bcrypt' library for password handling.)\n\n3) Final output:\n```python\n['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']\n```"}}]}

Wrapping a gift for your friend's surprise party can be a thoughtful and creative way to show your appreciation. I'd be happy to help you with some tips on how to wrap the book in a way that's both attractive and thoughtful.\n\n**Choose a suitable wrapping paper:**\n\nFor a \"Literature and Classics\" themed party, you may want to opt for a wrapping paper that complements the theme. Consider a paper with a vintage or classic design, such as a book-inspired print, a literary quote, or a subtle pattern reminiscent of old book pages. You can also choose a paper with a neutral color scheme, such as a soft beige, cream, or gray, which will allow the book to be the focal point.\n\n**Add a decorative touch:**\n\nTo make the gift stand out, add a decorative touch to the wrapping paper. You can use:\n\n1. A ribbon or twine: Choose a ribbon or twine that complements the color scheme of the wrapping paper. You can tie a simple bow or create a more elaborate design.\n2. A gift tag: Attach a gift tag with a literary quote, a message, or your friend's name to add a personal touch.\n3. A book-themed embellishment: Consider adding a small book-themed embellishment, such as a paper book clip, a bookmark, or a tiny paper bookworm.\n4. A sprig of greenery: Add a small sprig of greenery, such as a sprig of rosemary or a small fern, to give the gift a rustic or vintage feel.\n\n**Wrap the book neatly:**\n\nTo wrap the book, follow these steps:\n\n1. Measure the book: Measure the book's dimensions to ensure you have enough wrapping paper.\n2. Cut the wrapping paper: Cut the wrapping paper to the correct size, leaving a small margin around the edges.\n3. Place the book on the paper: Position the book in the center of the wrapping paper, ensuring it's aligned with the edges of the paper.\n4. Fold and crease: Fold the paper over the book, creasing the edges as you go. Make sure to fold the paper neatly and evenly.\n5. Secure with tape: Use clear tape to secure the paper in place, starting from the bottom edge and working your way up.\n6. Add the decorative touch: Add your chosen decorative touch, such as a ribbon or gift tag.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Consider using a book-shaped box or a gift box with a book-inspired design to add an extra layer of theme relevance.\n* If you're using a ribbon or twine, you can tie it in a bow or create a more elaborate design, such as a book-inspired knot.\n* Add a small gift card or a bookmark with a personal message to make the gift even more special.\n* If you're short on time, you can use a pre-made gift bag or a book bag with a literary theme.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll create a beautifully wrapped gift that's both thoughtful and relevant to the \"Literature and Classics\" theme.

The `Matrix` class has three member variables: `rows` to store the number of rows, `cols` to store the number of columns, and `data` to store the matrix data as a 1D vector.\n2.  The constructor `Matrix(int rows, int cols)` initializes the matrix with the given number of rows and columns, and initializes the `data` vector with zeros.\n3.  The `operator()` method allows access to individual elements of the matrix using row and column indices. It performs bounds checking and throws an `std::out_of_range` exception if the indices are out of bounds.\n4.  The `operator+` method performs matrix addition by taking another `Matrix` as an argument and returning a new `Matrix` with the sum of the two matrices. It checks if the dimensions of the matrices match and throws an `std::invalid_argument` exception if they do not.\n5.  The `print` method prints the matrix to the standard output, displaying the elements row by row.\n\nYou can use this class to create and manipulate matrices, like this:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    Matrix m1(2, 3);\n    m1(0, 0) = 1;\n    m1(0, 1) = 2;\n    m1(0, 2) = 3;\n    m1(1, 0) = 4;\n    m1(1, 1) = 5;\n    m1(1, 2) = 6;\n\n    Matrix m2(2, 3);\n    m2(0, 0) = 7;\n    m2(0, 1) = 8;\n    m2(0, 2) = 9;\n    m2(1, 0) = 10;\n    m2(1, 1) = 11;\n    m2(1, 2) = 12;\n\n    Matrix m3 = m1 + m2;\n    m3.print();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n8 10 12 \n14 16 18 \n```\n\nThis represents the sum of the two input matrices.\n\n#System#\n1) Please identify all 5 added constraints.\n2) For the 5 added constraints, discriminate if the #Answer of Initial Instruction + 5 constraints# satisfies each constraint.\n3) In the final line, only output a Python LIST with 5 elements ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "1.
