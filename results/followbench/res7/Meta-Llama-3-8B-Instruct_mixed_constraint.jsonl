{"prompt_new": "Prompt: Lost, found vodka, drank to forget.\n\nAccording to the above prompt, write a story that describes a man.", "result": "John woke up with a pounding headache, his mouth feeling like the Sahara desert. He slowly sat up, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar surroundings. He was in his living room, but everything seemed blurry and out of focus. He rubbed his temples, trying to massage away the throbbing pain.\n\nAs he looked around, he spotted a nearly empty bottle of vodka on the coffee table. A faint memory began to surface, and he groaned. He must have had a rough night. He couldn't remember what had happened, but he knew it wasn't good.\n\nJohn stumbled out of the chair and made his way to the kitchen, searching for some water to wash down the bitter taste in his mouth. As he splashed water on his face, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. His eyes were bloodshot, his skin pale, and his hair disheveled. He looked like he'd gone through a war.\n\nThe events of the previous night began to come back to him in fragments. He had been out with friends, celebrating a friend's birthday. They had gone to a bar, and he had gotten drunk. He remembered laughing, singing, and dancing with a woman he didn't know. But that was about it.\n\nJohn felt a pang of shame and regret. He didn't remember how he had gotten home or who the woman was. He didn't even know her name. He just knew that he had lost control, and now he was paying the price.\n\nAs he stood there, staring at his reflection, John realized that he needed to make a change. He couldn't keep living like this, drinking to forget his problems and losing himself in the process. He needed to find a way to deal with his demons head-on, rather than numbing himself with vodka.\n\nWith a newfound determination, John took a deep breath and began to clean up the mess from the night before. He poured the remaining vodka down the drain, and started to tidy up his apartment. As he worked, he felt a sense of clarity wash over him. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but he was ready to take the first step towards a new beginning."}
