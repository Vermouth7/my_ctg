In diesem meisterlichen Vortrag f\u00fchrt uns die Kunsthistorikerin Elizabeth Lev in einer entlang der Deckenmalereien des ber\u00fchmten Geb\u00e4udes und Michelangelos lebendiger Schilderung traditioneller Geschichten. Sie zeigt dabei, wie der Maler \u00fcber die religi\u00f6se Ikonographie der Zeit hinausgriff, um in der Kunst neue Wege zu gehen.
