He slowly sat up, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar surroundings. He was in a small, dingy apartment, with a worn-out couch and a coffee table littered with empty beer cans and fast food wrappers. A faint smell of stale cigarettes hung in the air.\n\nAs he tried to piece together the events of the previous night, he noticed a half-empty bottle of vodka on the coffee table. He remembered buying it at the liquor store on his way home from the bar, but everything after that was a blur.\n\nJohn rubbed his temples, trying to massage away the pain. He had been having a tough week, and the vodka had seemed like a good idea at the time. But now, he was paying the price.\n\nAs he stumbled out of the apartment, he noticed a piece of paper on the coffee table with a phone number scrawled on it. It was a number he didn't recognize, but he vaguely remembered calling it in a haze of intoxication.\n\nHe decided to call the number, hoping to piece together the events of the previous night. The phone rang several times before a groggy voice answered.\n\n\"Hello?\" a female voice said.\n\n\"Hi, is this... Rachel?\" John asked, his voice still thick with sleep.\n\nThere was a pause, and then Rachel spoke up. \"Yeah, it's me. Who is this?\"\n\nJohn hesitated, trying to remember how they had met. \"I'm... John. We met at the bar last night, right?\"\n\nRachel's laughter was husky and familiar. \"Oh, yeah. You're the guy who bought me a drink and then proceeded to get us lost in the city.\"\n\nJohn's face flushed with embarrassment. \"I'm so sorry about that. I don't really remember much after we left the bar.\"\n\nRachel chuckled. \"Don't worry about it. I had a good time, despite the fact that we got lost and ended up in some sketchy part of town.\"\n\nJohn breathed a sigh of relief. \"Thanks for being understanding. Can I take you out for dinner sometime to make up for it?\"\n\nRachel laughed again. \"I'd like that. But next time, let's stick to a nice, quiet dinner at home, okay?\"\n\nJohn grinned, feeling a sense of gratitude towards Rachel. \"Deal. And thanks for helping me find my way home last night.\"\n\nRachel's voice turned serious. \"No problem, John. Just be more careful next time, okay?\"\n\nJohn nodded, even though she couldn't see him. \"I will. Thanks again, Rachel.\"\n\nAs he hung up the phone, John couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. He had found a new friend, and maybe even a chance at something more. And he vowed to never drink to forget again."}

Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films. Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest \u00bb . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME).  We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing. The code, dataset, visualizations, and an interactive demo notebook are available in the supplemental materials.", "result": "The study finds that autoregressive transformer language models store and recall factual associations through localized, editable computations in mid-layer feed-forward modules, which can be directly manipulated using a technique called Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) to improve model performance on factual prediction tasks."}
{"prompt_new": "Summarize the below text using one sentence within 20 words.\n\nWe analyze the storage and recall of factual associations in autoregressive transformer language models, finding evidence that these associations correspond to localized, directly-editable computations. We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME).  We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another.
