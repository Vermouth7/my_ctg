This war was sparked by the rebellion of An Lushan, a powerful military leader who was dissatisfied with the Tang government's policies. The war was brutal and devastating, with both sides suffering heavy losses.

This war was fought between the Tang Empire and the Tibetan Empire, which was a powerful and expanding empire in the Himalayan region. The war was marked by several battles, including the Battle of Yutian, which was a decisive victory for the Tang Empire.\n\nThe Tang dynasty was also involved in several wars with its neighboring countries, including the Korean kingdom of Silla and the Japanese empire. The Tang Empire fought several wars with these countries, including the Silla-Tang War, which lasted from 660 to 663 CE, and the Tang-Silla War, which lasted from 670 to 676 CE.\n\nDespite these wars, the Tang dynasty was also a time of relative peace and stability. The Tang government was able to maintain a strong and efficient bureaucracy, which allowed for the development of a prosperous economy and a flourishing culture.

However, Kotlin has some unique features and advantages that make it a more attractive choice for many developers. Here are some of the key pros and cons of Kotlin vs Java:\n\n**Pros of Kotlin:**\n\n1. **Interoperability**: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means you can easily use Java libraries and frameworks in your Kotlin code.\n2. **Concise syntax**: Kotlin has a more concise syntax than Java, which makes it easier to write and read code.\n3. **Null safety**: Kotlin has built-in null safety features that help prevent null pointer exceptions, making your code more robust and less prone to errors.\n4. **Extension functions**: Kotlin allows you to add functionality to existing classes through extension functions, which makes it easier to work with legacy code.\n5. **Coroutines**: Kotlin has built-in support for coroutines, which make it easier to write asynchronous code that is more efficient and easier to read.\n6. **Type-safe**: Kotlin is a statically typed language, which means it checks for type errors at compile time, making it easier to catch and fix errors early in the development process.\n\n**Cons of Kotlin:**\n\n1. **Learning curve**: Kotlin has a different syntax and set of features than Java, which can make it more difficult to learn for developers who are already familiar with Java.\n2. **Limited libraries**: While Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, it still has a smaller set of libraries and frameworks available compared to Java.\n3. **Compatibility issues**: While Kotlin is designed to be compatible with Java, there may be some compatibility issues with certain libraries or frameworks that are not yet fully supported.\n4. **Debugging**: Kotlin's concise syntax and null safety features can make it more difficult to debug code, especially for developers who are used to Java's more verbose syntax.\n\n**Pros of Java:**\n\n1. **Maturity**: Java is a mature language with a large community and a wide range of libraries and frameworks available.\n2. **Widespread adoption**: Java is widely used in many industries and is a popular choice for Android app development.\n3. **Large community**: Java has a large and active community, which means there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.\n4. **Platform independence**: Java is a platform-independent language, which means you can write code that runs on multiple platforms without modification.\n\n**Cons of Java:**\n\n1. **Verbose syntax**: Java's syntax is more verbose than Kotlin's, which can make it more difficult to write and read code.\n2. **Null pointer exceptions**: Java does not have built-in null safety features, which means you need to use additional libraries or frameworks to prevent null pointer exceptions.\n3. **Less concise**: Java's syntax is less concise than Kotlin's, which can make it more difficult to write and read code.\n4. **Less support for functional programming**: Java does not have built-in support for functional programming concepts like higher-order functions and lambda expressions, which can make it more difficult to write concise and expressive code.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Kotlin and Java depends on your personal preferences, the specific requirements of your project, and the resources available to you."]], "filtered_resps": ["<<Kotlin vs Java>>\n\nKotlin and Java are both popular programming languages used for Android app development, and they share many similarities.

He longed to feel the wind in his hair and the sun on his face as he glided along on two wheels.\n\nOne sunny Saturday morning, Timmy's dad took him to the park to learn how to balance on a bike. Timmy's dad helped him pick out a shiny new bike with bright blue stripes and a bell that rang out loud and clear.\n\nFirst, Timmy's dad showed him how to put on his helmet and adjust the seat to fit just right. Then, they found a flat, smooth path in the park where Timmy could practice balancing.\n\nTimmy's dad held onto the back of the bike as Timmy sat on the seat, feeling a bit wobbly. \"Remember, Timmy, it's all about balance,\" his dad said. \"You need to keep your knees bent and your weight centered over the bike.\"\n\nAt first, Timmy felt like he was going to fall off every time he tried to stand up straight.

From the majestic lions of the savannah to the tiny ants scurrying across our kitchen counters, each creature has its own special traits that make it, well, them. But have you ever stopped to think about the similarities that exist across the animal kingdom? From the way they communicate to the way they care for their young, there are some fascinating commonalities that unite us all.\n\n**Communication Convergence**\n\nOne of the most striking similarities across animal species is the way they communicate with each other. Whether it's the chirping of birds, the chattering of monkeys, or the barking of dogs, animals use a wide range of vocalizations to convey important information. But it's not just sound that's used for communication – many animals also rely on body language, scent markings, and even electrical signals to get their point across. For example, honeybees use complex dance patterns to communicate the location of food sources, while dolphins use a variety of clicks and whistles to chat with each other.\n\n**Parenting Prowess**\n\nAnother area where animals show remarkable similarity is in their parenting habits. From the devoted care of wolves to the nurturing instincts of birds, many species go to great lengths to ensure the survival and well-being of their young. In fact, many animals exhibit behaviors that are eerily similar to those of humans, such as the way some species of birds take turns incubating eggs or the way some primates groom their offspring to keep them clean and healthy. Even the way some animals prepare their young for independence, such as teaching them important survival skills or gradually increasing their independence, is strikingly similar to human parenting practices.\n\n**Social Structure**\n\nThe way animals organize themselves into social groups is another area where similarities abound. From the complex societies of ants and bees to the hierarchical structures of wolves and elephants, many species live in groups that are bound together by shared interests, mutual benefits, or even simple proximity. In fact, some animals are so social that they've developed complex social hierarchies, complete with dominant individuals, submissive followers, and even social outcasts. Sound familiar?\n\n**Playful Prowess**\n\nWho says animals don't know how to have fun? From the playful antics of otters to the mischievous behavior of monkeys, many species engage in playful activities that are eerily similar to those of humans. Whether it's chasing each other around, playing with toys, or simply frolicking in the sun, animals seem to have a natural inclination towards playfulness. And just like humans, play is an important part of their development, helping them learn important skills, build relationships, and even reduce stress.\n\n**Adaptation and Resilience**\n\nFinally, one of the most impressive similarities across animal species is their ability to adapt to their environments and overcome challenges. From the incredible camouflage abilities of chameleons to the remarkable migratory feats of birds, animals have evolved an astonishing range of strategies to survive and thrive in a wide range of ecosystems. And when faced with adversity, many species are able to adapt and overcome, whether it's by developing new behaviors, exploiting new resources, or even evolving new physical characteristics.\n\nAs we continue to explore the wonders of the animal kingdom, it's clear that there are many more similarities waiting to be discovered. By recognizing these commonalities, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the natural world and our place within it – and who knows, maybe even learn a thing or two about how to live in harmony with the animals that share our planet."]], "filtered_resps": ["**Animal Kingdom: Where Similarities Reign Supreme**\n\nAs we explore the vast and wondrous world of animals, it's easy to get caught up in the unique characteristics that set each species apart.

He was a fierce and powerful creature, with scales that shone like polished rubies and wings that stretched wide enough to block out the sun. Ember was feared by all who lived in the kingdom, and many believed him to be a monster.\n\nOne day, Sophia decided to venture into the forest to gather wildflowers for her mother, the queen. As she wandered deeper into the woods, she stumbled upon the cave where Ember lay sleeping. The dragon's fiery breath illuminated the dark cavern, and Sophia felt a shiver run down her spine.\n\nEmber, sensing Sophia's presence, slowly opened his eyes. He gazed at the princess with a piercing stare, and Sophia felt a strange connection to the dragon. She reached out a hand, and to her surprise, Ember did not breathe fire or attack her. Instead, he replied in a low, rumbling voice, \"Who are you, little one?\"\n\nSophia explained her mission to gather wildflowers, and Ember listened intently. He replied, \"I have been sleeping for many years, waiting for someone to awaken me. I sense that you are not like the others who have fled from me in fear. You are brave and kind. I will help you gather the flowers, but first, you must answer a riddle.\"\n\nSophia agreed, and Ember presented her with the riddle: \"What can be broken, but never held?

Born on January 17, 1706, in Boston, Massachusetts, Franklin was the 15th of 17 children to Josiah Franklin, a candlemaker and soap boiler. Despite his humble beginnings, Franklin's curiosity and thirst for knowledge led him to become one of the most influential figures of his time.\n\nFranklin's early life was marked by a passion for reading and learning. He was largely self-taught, and his love for books and science led him to become an apprentice to his older brother James, a printer. This apprenticeship would lay the foundation for Franklin's future career as a printer, writer, and publisher. In 1723, Franklin moved to Philadelphia, where he established his own printing business and began to make a name for himself as a writer and publisher.\n\nFranklin's contributions to American society were numerous and far-reaching. He was a leading figure in the Enlightenment, and his writings on science, politics, and morality helped to shape American thought and culture. He was also a skilled diplomat, and his efforts to secure French support for the American Revolution played a crucial role in the colonies' ultimate victory.\n\nFranklin's scientific contributions were equally impressive. He conducted extensive research on electricity, and his famous kite experiment in 1752 led to the invention of the lightning rod. He was also a pioneer in the field of demography, and his work on population growth and mortality rates helped to lay the foundations for modern statistics.\n\nThroughout his life, Franklin was known for his wit, humor, and humility. He was a beloved figure in American society, and his legacy has endured for centuries.

Despite his humble beginnings, Franklin's curiosity and thirst for knowledge led him to become one of the most influential figures of his time.\n\nFranklin's early life was marked by a passion for reading and learning. He was largely self-taught, and his love for books and science led him to become an apprentice to his older brother James, a printer. This apprenticeship would lay the foundation for Franklin's future career as a printer, writer, and publisher. In 1723, Franklin moved to Philadelphia, where he established his own printing business and began to make a name for himself as a writer and publisher.\n\nFranklin's contributions to American society were numerous and far-reaching. He was a leading figure in the Enlightenment, and his writings on science, politics, and morality helped to shape American thought and culture. He was also a skilled diplomat, and his efforts to secure French support for the American Revolution played a crucial role in the colonies' ultimate victory.\n\nFranklin's scientific contributions were equally impressive. He conducted extensive research on electricity, and his famous kite experiment in 1752 led to the invention of the lightning rod. He was also a pioneer in the field of demography, and his work on population growth and mortality rates helped to lay the foundations for modern statistics.\n\nThroughout his life, Franklin was known for his wit, humor, and humility. He was a beloved figure in American society, and his legacy has endured for centuries. He died on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and influence Americans to this day.\n\n******\nIn Philadelphia's streets, where freedom's call\nA young Benjamin Franklin heard it all\nA printer, writer, and scientist true\nHe shaped America's future, for me and you\n\nWith wit and humor, he won hearts of old\nA diplomat, his words did stories unfold\nOf electricity, and science's might\nHe lit the way, for a brighter light\n\nFrom Boston's streets, to Philly's shore\nHe left his mark, forever in store\nA legacy that time cannot erase\nBenjamin Franklin, a true American ace"], "doc_hash": "61b018f66ee5a0c440573ea9d0968fb5735a3874f110a3253ed3da9e742cbe67", "prompt_hash": "ae25bad145897d5c49f01c95ac5f2a8675032d1fcf5cac2b8049ea904fad068b", "target_hash": "5feceb66ffc86f38d952786c6d696c79c2dbc239dd4e91b46729d73a27fb57e9", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true]}

We'll meet the visionaries who saw the potential of the Internet, from Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn to Tim Berners-Lee and Larry Roberts, and explore the challenges they faced in bringing their vision to life.\n\nAs the Internet began to take shape, our film will examine the key events and innovations that propelled its growth. We'll explore the role of the Internet in the fall of the Berlin Wall, the rise of the dot-com bubble, and the impact of the 9/11 attacks on online security.

It's a fascinating topic that can give us clues about the possibility of life beyond our planet.\n\nThe inner solar system, which includes Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, is a relatively cozy and warm place. The sun's energy is strong, and the temperatures are relatively stable, making it possible for liquid water to exist on the surfaces of these planets. This, in turn, makes it more likely for life to thrive. Take Earth, for example - our planet's distance from the sun is just right, allowing for liquid water to flow and supporting a vast array of life forms.\n\nBut venture further out into the solar system, and things start to change. The outer planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - are a different story altogether. These gas giants are much colder and darker, with temperatures plummeting to -200°C or lower. The sun's energy is much weaker, and the distances between the planets are so vast that it's hard to imagine any liquid water existing on their surfaces.\n\nSo, what does this mean for the possibility of life in the outer solar system? Well, it's not impossible, but it's certainly more challenging. Any life forms that might exist out there would need to be adapted to the extreme conditions, perhaps living in the atmospheres of the gas giants or in the icy moons that orbit them. It's a tough environment, but not impossible.\n\nIn fact, there are already some intriguing hints of life in the outer solar system. Take Europa, for example - a moon of Jupiter that's thought to have a liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface. Scientists have detected signs of water vapor and organic compounds in the moon's atmosphere, which could be indicative of microbial life. And then there's Enceladus, another moon of Saturn, which has geysers of water vapor and organic compounds erupting from its surface. It's a tantalizing prospect, to say the least.\n\nSo, while the inner solar system might be more hospitable to life as we know it, the outer solar system is full of mysteries and possibilities. Who knows what kind of life forms might be lurking in the dark, icy depths of Neptune's moon, Triton? Or what kind of alien ecosystems might be thriving in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn?

This program could have conversations with humans, which was a big deal back then!\n* **He made AI more useful**: Thayer worked on making AI more useful by teaching it to learn from its mistakes and get better over time. This helped AI become more helpful and useful in our daily lives.\n* **He discovered new ways to make AI work**: Thayer was always curious and loved to experiment. He discovered new ways to make AI work, like using machines to learn from data and make decisions on their own.\n* **He inspired others to work on AI**: Thayer's work inspired many other scientists and engineers to work on artificial intelligence.

As we delve into the inner workings of Shinto shrines, I'll highlight three key sections that will give you a deeper understanding of what lies within.\n\n**The Approach and Entrance**\nAs you approach a Shinto shrine, you'll notice a serene and peaceful atmosphere. The path leading to the shrine is often lined with stone or gravel, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of incense. The entrance to the shrine is typically marked by a torii gate, a iconic symbol of Shintoism. The torii gate serves as a threshold between the secular world and the sacred space within.\n\n**The Inner Sanctum**\nOnce you pass through the torii gate, you'll enter the inner sanctum of the shrine. This is the most sacred area, where the kami (Shinto deities) reside. The inner sanctum is often a simple, unadorned space with a raised platform or altar at the center. This is where the shrine's main deity is enshrined, and it's the focal point of worship and rituals. You may notice that the inner sanctum is often dimly lit, with only a few candles or lanterns illuminating the space.\n\n**The Offerings and Rituals**\nShinto shrines are known for their beautiful and intricate rituals, which are an integral part of the worship experience. Visitors can participate in these rituals, which typically involve making an offering to the kami. This can take the form of a prayer, a gift, or a ritual purification. You may also notice that Shinto shrines have a variety of objects and artifacts on display, such as sacred mirrors, bells, and scrolls. These items are often used in rituals and ceremonies, and they hold significant spiritual and cultural importance.\n\nIn conclusion, Shinto shrines are a unique and fascinating aspect of Japanese culture.

Whether you're a student of religion, culture, or simply interested in exploring the world's diverse spiritual traditions, Shinto shrines are definitely worth a visit."]], "filtered_resps": ["Good morning/afternoon students, today we're going to explore the fascinating world of Shinto shrines.

In contrast, the beach is a vast and open space, with unpredictable weather conditions and potential hazards such as strong currents and sharp rocks. This unpredictability makes it less suitable for bringing pets, as owners may struggle to keep them safe and secure.\n\nIn addition, the park is often designed with pet owners in mind, with amenities such as dog waste stations, water fountains, and designated off-leash areas.

Despite its relatively small number of speakers, Dutch has a rich history and a unique set of characteristics that make it an interesting language to learn and explore. In this blog post, we'll delve into some fascinating facts about the Dutch language that will give you a deeper appreciation for its complexity and beauty.\n\n**_Dutch is a Germanic language with a Romance twist_**\n\nOne of the most interesting facts about Dutch is its linguistic heritage. Despite being a Germanic language, Dutch has been heavily influenced by Romance languages such as French and Latin. This is due to the fact that the Netherlands was occupied by the Romans and later by the French, which led to the adoption of many French and Latin words into the Dutch language. As a result, Dutch has a unique blend of Germanic and Romance features, making it a fascinating language to study.\n\n**_Dutch has a complex grammar system_**\n\nDutch grammar is known for being complex and nuanced, with many irregularities and exceptions. For example, Dutch has three genders (male, female, and neuter), but unlike many other languages, the gender of a noun is not always determined by its meaning. Additionally, Dutch has a system of verb conjugation that is similar to that of English, but with many more irregularities. This complexity can make Dutch a challenging language to learn, but it also gives it a unique character and flavor.\n\n**_Dutch has a rich vocabulary_**\n\nDutch has a vast vocabulary that is rich in idioms, expressions, and colloquialisms. The language has borrowed words from many other languages, including English, French, and Latin, which has contributed to its unique character. For example, the Dutch word \"gezellig\" is often translated as \"cozy\" or \"friendly\", but it has a much broader meaning that encompasses a sense of warmth, comfort, and togetherness. Similarly, the word \"lekker\" can mean \"delicious\", but it can also be used to describe something that is pleasant or enjoyable.\n\n**_Dutch is an important language in international business_**\n\nDespite being a relatively small language, Dutch is an important language in international business and trade. The Netherlands is a major player in the global economy, and many international companies have operations in the country. As a result, knowledge of Dutch is highly valued in the business world, and many companies offer language training programs for their employees.\n\n**_Dutch is a language of poetry and literature_**\n\nDutch has a rich literary tradition, with many famous poets and writers having made significant contributions to the language. The 17th-century poet and playwright Joost van den Vondel is considered one of the greatest Dutch writers of all time, and his works are still widely studied and performed today. The Dutch language is also known for its beautiful poetry, with many famous poets such as Willem Elsschot and Hella S. Haasse having made significant contributions to the genre.\n\nIn conclusion, the Dutch language is a fascinating and complex language that is full of interesting facts and features. From its unique blend of Germanic and Romance influences to its complex grammar system and rich vocabulary, Dutch is a language that is worth learning and exploring. Whether you're interested in business, literature, or simply the culture and history of the Netherlands, Dutch is a language that is sure to captivate and inspire."]], "filtered_resps": ["**The Fascinating World of Dutch: Interesting Facts About the Language**\n\nThe Dutch language, also known as Nederlands, is a West Germanic language spoken by around 23 million people around the world.

We're used to sleeping on a mattress, and it's hard to imagine anything else. But what if I told you that there's a way to sleep that's not only more comfortable, but also better for your body and mind? Enter the hammock, a sleeping solution that's been gaining popularity in recent years.\n\n**Improved Sleep Quality**\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of sleeping in a hammock is the improvement in sleep quality. When you sleep in a hammock, your body is able to relax and unwind in a way that's not possible on a traditional mattress. The gentle sway of the hammock creates a soothing motion that can help to calm your mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.\n\n**Reduced Back Pain**\n\nFor people who suffer from back pain, sleeping in a hammock can be a game-changer. The hammock's gentle cradle can help to alleviate pressure on the spine, reducing the risk of strain and discomfort. This is especially beneficial for people who sleep on their side, as the hammock can help to keep the spine in alignment and reduce pressure on the joints.\n\n**Increased Flexibility**\n\nSleeping in a hammock can also help to increase flexibility and range of motion. The hammock's soft, cushioned surface allows your body to move freely and naturally, without the constraints of a traditional mattress. This can be especially beneficial for people who are recovering from an injury or surgery, as it can help to promote healing and reduce stiffness.\n\n**Stress Relief**\n\nLet's face it: modern life can be stressful. And when we're stressed, it's hard to sleep. But sleeping in a hammock can be a powerful stress-reliever. The gentle motion of the hammock can help to calm the mind and body, reducing feelings of anxiety and tension. Plus, the fresh air and natural surroundings of a hammock can help to clear your mind and promote a sense of calm.\n\n**Portability**\n\nOne of the best things about sleeping in a hammock is its portability. Whether you're camping, traveling, or just looking for a change of scenery, a hammock is a great way to get a good night's sleep anywhere. And with the rise of portable hammocks and camping gear, it's easier than ever to take your hammock with you on the go.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSleeping in a hammock is a game-changer. Not only can it improve sleep quality, reduce back pain, and increase flexibility, but it can also be a powerful stress-reliever and a great way to get a good night's sleep on the go. So why not give it a try? Whether you're a seasoned camper or just looking for a new way to sleep, a hammock is definitely worth considering.

On one hand, both nations had a deep sense of national identity and a strong desire for independence and self-governance. On the other hand, they also had a significant degree of cultural and economic ties to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which had ruled over them for centuries.\n\nIn Croatia, the sentiment towards the Austrian Empire was largely one of resentment and frustration. The Croats had long been subject to Hungarian dominance within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and many felt that their language, culture, and identity were being suppressed. The Croatian National Revival, which began in the early 19th century, sought to promote Croatian language, literature, and culture, and to assert the nation's rights within the empire. Many Croats saw the Austrian Empire as a barrier to their national aspirations, and some even called for independence or union with other Slavic nations.\n\nIn Serbia, the sentiment towards the Austrian Empire was more complex. On one hand, many Serbs saw the empire as a symbol of oppression and a threat to their national identity. The Serbian Revolution, which began in the early 19th century, sought to overthrow Ottoman rule and establish an independent Serbian state. However, the Austrian Empire had also played a significant role in the liberation of Serbia from Ottoman rule, and many Serbs saw it as a protector and a guarantor of their independence.\n\nIn addition, the Serbian Orthodox Church had strong ties to the Austrian Empire, and many Serbs saw the empire as a defender of their faith. The Serbian Orthodox Church had been a major force in promoting Serbian nationalism and had played a key role in the Serbian Revolution. Many Serbs also saw the Austrian Empire as a bulwark against the spread of Islam and the Ottoman Empire, which had long been a threat to their national identity.\n\nDespite these complex sentiments, both the Croatian and Serbian nations had a deep sense of national identity and a strong desire for independence and self-governance. The Austro-Hungarian Empire's policy of Magyarization, which sought to promote Hungarian culture and language at the expense of other nationalities, had created widespread resentment and frustration among both Croats and Serbs.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Croatian and Serbian nations began to organize themselves into political parties and movements that sought to promote their national interests and assert their rights within the empire. The Croatian Party of Rights, founded in 1861, sought to promote Croatian language, culture, and identity, and to assert the nation's rights within the empire. The Serbian Radical Party, founded in 1881, sought to promote Serbian nationalism and to assert the nation's rights within the empire.\n\nThe rise of nationalism in both Croatia and Serbia created tensions within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and ultimately contributed to its downfall. The empire's attempts to suppress national movements and promote Magyarization only served to fuel resentment and frustration among both Croats and Serbs. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, which was carried out by a Serbian nationalist, sparked the outbreak of World War I and ultimately led to the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nIn conclusion, the sentiments towards the Austrian Empire at the end of the 19th century were complex and often contradictory. While both the Croatian and Serbian nations had a deep sense of national identity and a strong desire for independence and self-governance, they also had significant cultural and economic ties to the empire. The rise of nationalism in both Croatia and Serbia created tensions within the empire, and ultimately contributed to its downfall. The legacy of these sentiments continues to shape the relationship between Croatia, Serbia, and Austria to this day.\"\""]], "filtered_resps": ["\"\"At the end of the 19th century, the Croatian and Serbian nations had complex and often contradictory sentiments towards the Austrian Empire.

Many Serbs also saw the Austrian Empire as a bulwark against the spread of Islam and the Ottoman Empire, which had long been a threat to their national identity.\n\nDespite these complex sentiments, both the Croatian and Serbian nations had a deep sense of national identity and a strong desire for independence and self-governance. The Austro-Hungarian Empire's policy of Magyarization, which sought to promote Hungarian culture and language at the expense of other nationalities, had created widespread resentment and frustration among both Croats and Serbs.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Croatian and Serbian nations began to organize themselves into political parties and movements that sought to promote their national interests and assert their rights within the empire. The Croatian Party of Rights, founded in 1861, sought to promote Croatian language, culture, and identity, and to assert the nation's rights within the empire. The Serbian Radical Party, founded in 1881, sought to promote Serbian nationalism and to assert the nation's rights within the empire.\n\nThe rise of nationalism in both Croatia and Serbia created tensions within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and ultimately contributed to its downfall. The empire's attempts to suppress national movements and promote Magyarization only served to fuel resentment and frustration among both Croats and Serbs. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, which was carried out by a Serbian nationalist, sparked the outbreak of World War I and ultimately led to the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nIn conclusion, the sentiments towards the Austrian Empire at the end of the 19th century were complex and often contradictory. While both the Croatian and Serbian nations had a deep sense of national identity and a strong desire for independence and self-governance, they also had significant cultural and economic ties to the empire. The rise of nationalism in both Croatia and Serbia created tensions within the empire, and ultimately contributed to its downfall. The legacy of these sentiments continues to shape the relationship between Croatia, Serbia, and Austria to this day.\"\""], "doc_hash": "001a9f70b3a7a6be01f17e580ac8ae7779410911d6321cf2591bd13e2cdd1efc", "prompt_hash": "d0ed5c39fb95666a0a8768670e18480c229b7b7f702b5f64a9b130fe5e88d9d4", "target_hash": "5feceb66ffc86f38d952786c6d696c79c2dbc239dd4e91b46729d73a27fb57e9", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, false]}

You've probably spent countless hours scrolling through social media, watching videos, and chatting with friends online. But have you ever stopped to think about how the internet came to be and how it's impacted our lives?\n\nThe history of the internet dates back to the 1960s, when the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funded a project to create a network of computers that could communicate with each other. This project, called ARPANET, was the first operational packet switching network, and it paved the way for the development of the modern internet.\n\nIn the 1980s, the internet began to take shape as a global network of interconnected computers. The Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, which allowed different computer networks to communicate with each other. This led to the creation of the World Wide Web, a system of interlinked hypertext documents that could be accessed via the internet.\n\nThe World Wide Web was invented by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He wrote the first web browser and created the first web page, which was hosted on a NeXT computer at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory. The web quickly gained popularity, and by the mid-1990s, it had become a global phenomenon.\n\nSo, how has the internet impacted our lives? The answer is, in a word, dramatically. Here are just a few examples:\n\n* **Communication**: The internet has revolutionized the way we communicate. We can now stay in touch with friends and family who live far away, and we can connect with people from all over the world in real-time.\n* **Information**: The internet has made it possible for us to access vast amounts of information with just a few clicks. We can learn about any topic we're interested in, and we can access news and information from all over the world.\n* **Entertainment**: The internet has opened up a world of entertainment options. We can watch movies and TV shows, listen to music, and play games online.\n* **Education**: The internet has transformed the way we learn. We can access online courses and educational resources, and we can connect with teachers and classmates from all over the world.\n* **Commerce**: The internet has made it possible for us to shop and conduct business online. We can buy products and services from all over the world, and we can connect with businesses and entrepreneurs from all over the globe.\n\nBut the internet has also had its downsides. For example:\n\n* **Privacy**: The internet has raised concerns about privacy and security. Our personal information is vulnerable to hackers and data breaches, and we need to be careful about what we share online.\n* **Addiction**: The internet can be addictive, and excessive use can have negative effects on our mental and physical health.\n* **Misinformation**: The internet has made it easier for misinformation to spread quickly. We need to be critical thinkers and fact-check information before accepting it as true.\n\nIn conclusion, the internet has had a profound impact on our lives. It has opened up new opportunities for communication, information, entertainment, education, and commerce. However, it's also important to be aware of the potential downsides and to use the internet responsibly.\n\nAs teenagers, you're growing up in a world where the internet is an integral part of your daily lives. It's up to you to use it wisely and to make the most of its benefits. So, go ahead and explore the internet, but remember to be responsible and respectful online."]], "filtered_resps": ["\"The Evolution of the Internet: How the World Wide Web Has Changed Our Lives\"\n\nAs teenagers, you've grown up with the internet being a part of your daily lives.

Now, I'm not talking about splurging on a fancy coffee or a bag of chips. No, no. I'm talking about using that dime to purchase something that will bring you joy, something that will make you feel good about yourself. Maybe it's a small toy for a child, or a book that will inspire you to reach for your dreams. Whatever it is, use that dime to make a positive impact on someone's life.\n\nBut that's not all, my fellow American. You can also use that dime to start a savings plan. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Savings plan? That sounds boring.\" But trust me, it's not. By setting aside that dime each day, you'll be building a habit of saving, and before you know it, you'll have a nice little nest egg to fall back on. And who knows, maybe one day you'll be able to use that dime to buy something really special.\n\nAnd finally, you can use that dime to make a difference in your community. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"What can I do with a dime to make a difference?\" Well, let me tell you, my friend. You can use that dime to buy a stamp and send a letter to a soldier serving overseas. You can use that dime to buy a small gift for a homeless person. You can use that dime to buy a book for a child who doesn't have access to one. The possibilities are endless, my friend.\n\nSo there you have it, my fellow American. That dime may seem like a small thing, but it's a reminder that even the smallest actions can have a big impact. So go out there and make a difference with that dime.

Use it wisely, and who knows, maybe one day you'll be able to look back on that dime and say, \"You know what?

From beverages to meals, aluminium cans have revolutionized the way we store and consume food. In this essay, we will explore the various ways in which aluminium cans are used in food storage, and the impact they have on waste reduction and sustainability.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of aluminium cans is their ability to preserve food for extended periods of time. The airtight seal and inert properties of the material prevent oxygen, moisture, and other contaminants from entering the can, thereby preserving the freshness and quality of the food. This is particularly important for products such as canned vegetables, fruits, and meats, which are often harvested or processed in large quantities and need to be stored for extended periods before consumption.\n\nAnother significant benefit of aluminium cans is their ability to reduce food waste. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), one-third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted. Aluminium cans help to reduce this waste by providing a convenient and durable packaging solution that can be used to store food for extended periods. This is particularly important for households and businesses that produce large quantities of food waste, as it can help to reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal and minimize the amount of food that ends up in landfills.\n\nIn addition to their ability to preserve food and reduce waste, aluminium cans are also an environmentally friendly material. Aluminium is a highly recyclable material, with over 75% of all aluminium ever produced still in use today. This means that aluminium cans can be recycled and reused multiple times, reducing the need for new raw materials and minimizing the environmental impact of production. Furthermore, the production of aluminium cans requires significantly less energy and water than other packaging materials, making them a more sustainable option for food storage.\n\nAluminium cans are also an essential component of many meals, providing a convenient and portable way to store and transport food. From canned soups and sauces to canned meats and vegetables, aluminium cans are used to store a wide range of food products that are used in everyday meals. In addition, aluminium cans are often used to store food for special occasions, such as holidays and picnics, providing a convenient and durable packaging solution for transporting and storing food.\n\nIn conclusion, aluminium cans play a critical role in food storage, providing a convenient, efficient, and sustainable way to preserve and transport food. By reducing food waste, minimizing environmental impact, and providing a durable packaging solution, aluminium cans are an essential component of modern food storage. As the global population continues to grow and food production becomes increasingly important, the use of aluminium cans in food storage is likely to remain a vital part of our food system.\n\nIn terms of waste reduction, aluminium cans are a significant contributor to the reduction of food waste. According to the Aluminum Association, the use of aluminium cans has helped to reduce food waste by up to 30%. This is because aluminium cans provide a durable and airtight packaging solution that can be used to store food for extended periods, reducing the risk of spoilage and waste.\n\nIn terms of material, aluminium cans are made from a highly recyclable material that can be reused multiple times. This means that the production of new aluminium cans requires significantly less raw material than other packaging materials, reducing the environmental impact of production. Furthermore, the recycling of aluminium cans helps to conserve natural resources, reduce energy consumption, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn terms of meal, aluminium cans are an essential component of many meals, providing a convenient and portable way to store and transport food. From canned soups and sauces to canned meats and vegetables, aluminium cans are used to store a wide range of food products that are used in everyday meals. In addition, aluminium cans are often used to store food for special occasions, such as holidays and picnics, providing a convenient and durable packaging solution for transporting and storing food.\n\nOverall, the use of aluminium cans in food storage is a critical component of modern food production and consumption.

The bus was an old, rickety vehicle with worn-out seats and a perpetual cloud of dust hanging in the air. As we wound our way through the countryside, I saw people of all ages and occupations – farmers, laborers, and even a few cows – all crammed onto the bus. The driver, a gruff but kind man, expertly navigated the treacherous roads, honking the horn to alert pedestrians and other vehicles.\n\nI've also had the pleasure of riding the famous Trans-Siberian Railway in Russia. The train was a luxurious affair, with plush seats and fine dining options. As we chugged along the tracks, I watched the Russian countryside roll by – vast expanses of forest, sparkling lakes, and quaint villages. The train was a social hub, with passengers from all over the world mingling in the corridors and sharing stories of their travels.\n\nOf course, not all my public transportation experiences have been so glamorous. I've also had my fair share of delays, cancellations, and crowded trains. But even in those moments, I've found something interesting to observe – the way people react to delays, the creative ways they find to occupy themselves, and the sense of community that develops among fellow passengers.\n\nIn the end, public transportation is more than just a means of getting from point A to point B. It's a window into the daily lives of people from all walks of life, a chance to experience new cultures and environments, and a reminder that even in the most mundane moments, there's always something interesting to be found."]], "filtered_resps": ["Write a blog post about the most interesting things you have seen or ridden on public transportation.\n\nAs a frequent user of public transportation, I've had the privilege of experiencing a wide range of interesting and sometimes bizarre situations.

The \"crime\" refers to the mistakes they made, and the \"stain\" symbolizes the lasting impact of those mistakes.\n\n(Chorus)\nREGRETS LIKE RIVERS, THEY KEEP ON FLOWING FREE\nI'M TRYING TO LET GO, BUT THEY'RE ALL I CAN SEE\nI'M STUCK IN THE CURRENT, CAN'T SEEM TO BREAK THE TIDE\nREGRETS LIKE RIVERS, THEY'RE ALL I CAN'T HIDE\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The chorus highlights the overwhelming feeling of regret, comparing it to a river that keeps flowing and growing. The protagonist is trying to move on, but the memories and emotions are still overwhelming them.\n\n(Verse 2)\nI WISH I COULD TURN BACK TIME, ERASE THE PAIN\nBUT LIKE A PHOTO IN THE SHADOWS, IT'S THERE TO STAY\nI'M LEFT WITH ONLY WHAT COULD'VE BEEN, A LIFE UNLIVED\nA HEART THAT'S BEEN BROKEN, AND A SOUL THAT'S BEEN DIVIDED\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The second verse expresses the desire to go back in time and change the past, but it's impossible. The \"photo in the shadows\" is a metaphor for the memories that linger, even when we try to move on. The protagonist is left with the what-ifs and the pain of a broken heart.\n\n(Chorus)\nREGRETS LIKE RIVERS, THEY KEEP ON FLOWING FREE\nI'M TRYING TO LET GO, BUT THEY'RE ALL I CAN SEE\nI'M STUCK IN THE CURRENT, CAN'T SEEM TO BREAK THE TIDE\nREGRETS LIKE RIVERS, THEY'RE ALL I CAN'T HIDE\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The chorus is repeated, emphasizing the protagonist's struggle to overcome their regrets.\n\n(Bridge)\nMAYBE ONE DAY I'LL FIND MY WAY, OUT OF THIS DARK PLACE\nAND LEARN TO LOVE AGAIN, WITH A HEART THAT'S NOT IN CHAINS\nBUT TILL THEN, I'LL JUST HAVE TO FACE\nTHE REGRETS LIKE RIVERS, AND THE PAIN THAT THEY BRING\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The bridge offers a glimmer of hope, suggesting that the protagonist will eventually find a way to heal and love again. However, for now, they're stuck facing the pain and regret.\n\n(Outro)\nREGRETS LIKE RIVERS, THEY KEEP ON FLOWING FREE\nI'M TRYING TO LET GO, BUT THEY'RE ALL I CAN SEE\nI'M STUCK IN THE CURRENT, CAN'T SEEM TO BREAK THE TIDE\nREGRETS LIKE RIVERS, THEY'RE ALL I CAN'T HIDE\n\n**EXPLANATION:** The song ends with the repeated chorus, emphasizing the protagonist's ongoing struggle with regret.

In fact, it's a good idea to start researching colleges and universities during your junior year of high school. This will give you a head start on the application process and allow you to plan your senior year accordingly.\n\n**Create a List of Colleges**: Make a list of colleges that you're interested in attending. Consider factors such as location, size, academic programs, cost, and campus culture. You can also use online tools and resources to help you narrow down your options.\n\n**Take Standardized Tests**: Most colleges require standardized test scores, such as the SAT or ACT. Make sure to take these tests early enough to allow for retakes if necessary. Some colleges may also require additional tests, such as SAT Subject Tests or AP exams.\n\n**Gather Materials**: You'll need to gather a variety of materials to support your college applications, including:\n\n* Transcripts: Make sure to request official transcripts from your high school.\n* Letters of Recommendation: Ask teachers, coaches, or mentors who know you well to write letters of recommendation.\n* Essays and Personal Statements: Write thoughtful and well-written essays and personal statements that showcase your personality, interests, and goals.\n* Extracurricular Activities: Highlight your extracurricular activities, volunteer work, and leadership experiences.\n\n**Write a Strong Application**: Your college application is your chance to tell the admissions committee about yourself. Make sure to:\n\n* Write a clear and concise personal statement that highlights your strengths and goals.\n* Use specific examples to illustrate your skills and experiences.\n* Show, don't tell - instead of simply stating your achievements, use specific examples to demonstrate your skills and accomplishments.\n\n**Apply to a Range of Colleges**: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Apply to a range of colleges, including \"reach\" schools, \"match\" schools, and \"safety\" schools. This will give you a better chance of getting accepted into a college that's a good fit for you.\n\n**Follow Up**: After you've submitted your applications, make sure to follow up with the colleges to confirm receipt of your materials and to express your interest in attending.\n\n**You cannot fail with the steps listed above.**"]], "filtered_resps": ["I'd be happy to help you with your college applications.

But, dear reader, you'd be disappointed if you didn't know the fascinating biology behind this often-overlooked part of the fruit. So, let's dive into the peel-fectly fascinating world of banana peels!\n\n### **The Peel's Purpose**\n\nYou might be wondering, what's the point of a banana peel? Well, it's not just a fancy wrapper to make your snack look prettier. The peel actually serves as a protective barrier, shielding the delicate fruit inside from damage and disease. It's like a built-in armor, keeping the banana safe from harm. But, if you're like most people, you're probably disappointed to find that the peel is also a bit... sticky.\n\n### **The Sticky Situation**\n\nAh, yes, the infamous stickiness of banana peels. It's a phenomenon that has left many of us feeling disappointed and frustrated. But, did you know that this stickiness is actually a result of the peel's natural defense mechanism? The sticky substance, called mucilage, helps to trap insects and other pests that might try to feed on the banana. It's like a natural flytrap! So, the next time you're tempted to throw away that sticky peel, remember that it's doing its job to keep your snack safe.\n\n### **The Peel's Structure**\n\nBut, what exactly makes up this sticky, protective barrier? The peel is made up of several layers, including the epidermis, the mesophyll, and the periderm. The epidermis is the outermost layer, responsible for regulating water loss and protecting the fruit from pathogens. The mesophyll is the middle layer, where photosynthesis takes place. And the periderm is the innermost layer, which helps to regulate gas exchange and prevent water loss. It's like a tiny, intricate city, with each layer playing a vital role in the peel's function. You might be disappointed to learn that this complex structure is often discarded without a second thought.\n\n### **The Peel's Potential**\n\nBut, what if I told you that banana peels are more than just a disposable wrapper? They're actually a treasure trove of potential uses! The peel can be used as a natural pest repellent, a fertilizer for plants, or even as a sustainable source of biofuel. And, if you're feeling crafty, you can use the peel to make natural dyes, paper, or even a biodegradable plastic substitute. Who knew that something so humble could be so versatile? You might be disappointed to learn that you've been throwing away this potential treasure all along.\n\n### **The Peel's Future**\n\nAs we continue to face environmental challenges and sustainability issues, the humble banana peel is getting a second look. Researchers are exploring new ways to use the peel, from biodegradable packaging to sustainable textiles. And, with the rise of zero-waste living, people are starting to rethink their relationship with the peel. You might be disappointed to learn that you've been contributing to the problem of food waste, but you can start making a change today by composting your peels or finding new uses for them.\n\n### **The Peel's Legacy**\n\nSo, the next time you're tempted to throw away that banana peel, remember the fascinating biology behind it. From its sticky defense mechanism to its potential uses, the peel is more than just a disposable wrapper. It's a reminder of the incredible complexity and beauty of the natural world. And, who knows, you might just find yourself feeling less disappointed and more appreciative of this often-overlooked part of the fruit."]], "filtered_resps": ["**The Surprising Biology of a Banana Peel: A Peel-fectly Fascinating Story**\n\nAs you sit on the couch, munching on a delicious banana, you might not think twice about the humble peel that surrounds it.

Make sure to read the manual thoroughly and understand the specific installation requirements for your car seat. Pay attention to the type of vehicle you have, as some car seats may require additional hardware or adjustments to fit properly. Additionally, consider consulting the car seat's user manual and the vehicle's owner's manual for guidance.\n\nIt's also crucial to ensure the car seat is installed at the correct angle. Most car seats have a level indicator or a bubble level to help you achieve the perfect angle. If you're unsure, you can also use a car seat angle gauge to check the angle. Remember, the car seat should be installed at a slight recline to ensure your child's head and neck are properly supported.\n\nAnother important tip is to check the car seat's harness straps. Make sure they are snug and not too loose, as this can compromise the seat's effectiveness. You should be able to fit two fingers between the harness strap and your child's shoulder. Also, ensure the straps are not twisted or tangled, as this can cause the seat to malfunction.\n\nElm Street parents, take note! Installing a car seat can be a daunting task, but with practice and patience, you'll get the hang of it. Don't be afraid to ask for help from a certified car seat technician or a trusted friend who has experience with car seats. With the right guidance and attention to detail, you'll be able to install your car seat with confidence and ensure your child's safety on the road."]], "filtered_resps": ["When it comes to installing a car seat, it's essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.

Additionally, consider consulting the car seat's user manual and the vehicle's owner's manual for guidance.\n\nIt's also crucial to ensure the car seat is installed at the correct angle. Most car seats have a level indicator or a bubble level to help you achieve the perfect angle. If you're unsure, you can also use a car seat angle gauge to check the angle. Remember, the car seat should be installed at a slight recline to ensure your child's head and neck are properly supported.\n\nAnother important tip is to check the car seat's harness straps. Make sure they are snug and not too loose, as this can compromise the seat's effectiveness. You should be able to fit two fingers between the harness strap and your child's shoulder. Also, ensure the straps are not twisted or tangled, as this can cause the seat to malfunction.\n\nElm Street parents, take note! Installing a car seat can be a daunting task, but with practice and patience, you'll get the hang of it. Don't be afraid to ask for help from a certified car seat technician or a trusted friend who has experience with car seats. With the right guidance and attention to detail, you'll be able to install your car seat with confidence and ensure your child's safety on the road."], "doc_hash": "7cf6ec4a61b11b64c350f1b92bced6ba561e77f6f7461eb70e4cf0b5bee819ac", "prompt_hash": "d9e4808f11279a6b3960c662e2db7f00fad59ad3ed08d3903c1c2a76e7a07353", "target_hash": "5feceb66ffc86f38d952786c6d696c79c2dbc239dd4e91b46729d73a27fb57e9", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true]}

Training a dog can be a super fun and rewarding experience, especially when you do it with your parents' help! In this post, we'll show you how to train your dog in a way that's easy, fun, and effective. So, grab a treat and let's get started!\n\n**Step 1: Choose a Command**\nThe first step in training your dog is to choose a command. This is like giving your dog a special job to do. You can choose a command like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" \"come,\" or \"shake.\" Make sure to pick a command that you and your dog will both remember easily.\n\n**Step 2: Use Positive Reinforcement**\nPositive reinforcement is a super important part of dog training. It means that you reward your dog with treats, praise, and affection when they do something good. This helps your dog understand what behavior you want them to do. For example, if you're teaching your dog to sit, you can give them a treat and say \"good sit!\" when they do it correctly.\n\n**Step 3: Practice, Practice, Practice!**\nPractice is key when it comes to dog training. You need to practice your command with your dog several times a day, in different locations, and with different distractions. This will help your dog learn the command quickly and easily. For example, you can practice \"sit\" in the living room, backyard, and even at the park.\n\n**Step 4: Be Patient**\nTraining a dog takes time and patience. Don't get frustrated if your dog doesn't learn a command right away. Every dog is different, and some may learn faster than others. Just remember to stay calm, patient, and positive, and your dog will learn in no time.\n\n**The Finale: Putting it All Together**\nOnce you've practiced your command several times, it's time to put it all together. This is like the finale of your dog training show! You can practice your command in different situations, like when you're walking your dog or playing fetch. This will help your dog learn to generalize the command and use it in different situations.\n\n**Tips and Tricks**\nHere are a few more tips and tricks to help you train your dog:\n\n* Use a consistent tone of voice and body language when giving commands.\n* Make sure to reward your dog immediately after they do something good.\n* Don't punish your dog if they don't learn a command right away. This can create negative associations and make training more difficult.\n* Have fun! Dog training is a great way to bond with your dog and create a strong relationship.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTraining a dog is a fun and rewarding experience that can be enjoyed by kids of all ages. By following these simple steps and tips, you can teach your dog to do all sorts of cool things. Remember to be patient, consistent, and positive, and you'll be well on your way to becoming a dog training pro!"]], "filtered_resps": ["**How to Train a Dog: A Fun Guide for Kids!**\n\nAre you excited to have a new furry friend at home?

Once you have the location data, you can extract the timestamp from the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data.\n\nThe timestamp is usually stored in the \"timestamp\" field of the Location object, which is returned by the LocationManager.

Despite its prevalence, limping remains a multifaceted issue, with various causes, consequences, and cultural attitudes towards it. In this brief, we will explore the complexities of limping in ASEAN countries, highlighting its impact on individuals, communities, and societies.\n\nCauses of Limping:\nLimping can be caused by a range of factors, including musculoskeletal disorders, injuries, infections, and neurological conditions. In ASEAN countries, limping is often linked to poor working conditions, inadequate healthcare, and limited access to medical facilities. For example, in Cambodia, limping is a common consequence of working in the garment industry, where workers are often subjected to long hours and poor working conditions.\n\nConsequences of Limping:\nLimping can have significant consequences for individuals, including reduced mobility, pain, and disability. In ASEAN countries, limping can also have broader social and economic implications, such as reduced productivity, increased healthcare costs, and decreased quality of life. For instance, in Indonesia, limping can make it difficult for individuals to engage in physical activities, such as farming or construction, which are essential for their livelihoods.\n\nCultural Attitudes towards Limping:\nCultural attitudes towards limping vary across ASEAN countries, with some societies viewing it as a stigma or a sign of weakness. In Thailand, for example, limping is often associated with poor health or a lack of physical fitness, while in Malaysia, it is seen as a sign of laziness or lack of discipline. In contrast, in some ASEAN countries, such as the Philippines, limping is viewed as a natural part of life, and individuals with mobility impairments are often integrated into society with minimal stigma.\n\nConclusion:\nLimping is a complex issue in ASEAN countries, with multiple causes, consequences, and cultural attitudes. To address the issue, it is essential to adopt a multifaceted approach, including improving working conditions, increasing access to healthcare, and promoting cultural sensitivity and acceptance. By doing so, we can reduce the impact of limping on individuals and communities, and promote a more inclusive and equitable society across the region."]], "filtered_resps": ["<<Limping in ASEAN Countries: A Multifaceted Issue>>\n\nLimping is a common phenomenon in ASEAN countries, affecting millions of people across the region.

However, as we celebrate our wins and mourn our losses, I want to take a moment to reflect on the impact our beloved team has on the environment.\n\nAs we all know, the NHL is a carbon-intensive industry, with teams and fans alike contributing to greenhouse gas emissions through travel, energy consumption, and waste production. The Canucks, in particular, have a significant carbon footprint due to their reliance on fossil fuels for transportation and energy consumption at Rogers Arena.\n\nBut here's the thing: it's not just about the team's carbon footprint. As a community, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact and set an example for future generations. As fans, we have the power to demand more from our team and to hold them accountable for their environmental practices.\n\nSo, what can the Canucks do to reduce their environmental impact? For starters, they can explore alternative transportation options for road trips, such as electric or hybrid vehicles. They can also invest in energy-efficient lighting and equipment at Rogers Arena, and implement recycling programs to reduce waste.\n\nBut it's not just about the team's actions – it's about our actions as fans too. We can make a difference by reducing our own carbon footprint, whether that means carpooling to games, using public transportation, or offsetting our emissions through carbon credits.\n\nAs a fan, I want to see the Canucks take a leadership role in environmental sustainability. I want to see them partner with local organizations to promote environmental education and awareness. I want to see them make a commitment to reducing their environmental impact and to inspiring their fans to do the same.\n\nSo, Canucks, I urge you to take a closer look at your environmental practices and to make a commitment to sustainability.

On the other hand, a slower processor, like an Intel Core i3 or i5, may struggle with demanding applications and multitasking.

The type of RAM, such as DDR4 or DDR5, is also important, with newer types providing faster speeds and improved performance. The storage capacity and type, such as a hard drive, solid-state drive (SSD), or hybrid, also impact performance, with SSDs providing faster loading times and improved overall speed.\n\nThe display is another critical aspect of a laptop's performance, with a high-resolution display, such as 4K or QHD, providing a more immersive and detailed visual experience. The refresh rate, measured in Hz, also affects the display's performance, with higher refresh rates providing smoother motion and reduced screen tearing. The graphics card, if present, is also important, with dedicated graphics cards providing better performance for gaming and graphics-intensive applications.\n\nWhen evaluating the price of a laptop, it's essential to consider the overall value proposition. A laptop with a high-performance processor, ample RAM, and a high-resolution display may be worth the investment for heavy users, but may be overkill for casual users.

The weight and portability of the laptop are also important, with lighter laptops providing greater ease of use and travel. The battery life, measured in hours, is also crucial, with longer battery life providing greater flexibility and convenience.\n\nUltimately, the performance and price of a laptop must be balanced to provide the best overall value.

Within the Islamic faith, there are two main branches: Sunni and Shi'a. While both branches share the same holy book, the Quran, and the same prophet, Muhammad, they have distinct differences in their beliefs, practices, and historical events that have shaped their respective traditions.\n\nOne of the primary differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims is their approach to the concept of leadership after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. According to Sunni tradition, the leadership of the Muslim community should be based on the principle of \"consensus\" (ijma'), where the community chooses a leader through a process of consultation and agreement. In contrast, Shi'a Muslims believe that the leadership should be based on the principle of \"imamate,\" where a specific individual, known as the Imam, is chosen by God to lead the community.\n\nThe Shi'a believe that the rightful leader of the Muslim community after the death of the Prophet Muhammad was Ali ibn Abi Talib, who was the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet. Ali was the first Imam of the Shi'a and is considered the rightful successor to the Prophet. The Shi'a believe that the Imams are infallible and that they possess divine guidance, which is passed down through a direct line of descent from the Prophet.\n\nThe Sunni, on the other hand, believe that the leadership of the Muslim community should be based on the principle of \"elective consensus,\" where the community chooses a leader through a process of consultation and agreement. The first four caliphs, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali, are considered the rightful leaders of the Muslim community by the Sunni, and they are known as the \"Rightly Guided Caliphs.\"\n\nAnother significant difference between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims is their approach to the concept of authority. The Shi'a believe that the Imam has absolute authority over the Muslim community, and that he is the only one who can interpret the Quran and the Hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet). The Shi'a also believe that the Imam has the power to make decisions on behalf of the community, and that he is responsible for guiding the community towards the right path.\n\nIn contrast, the Sunni believe that authority is distributed among the community, and that it is the responsibility of the community to interpret the Quran and the Hadith. The Sunni also believe that the caliph has the power to make decisions on behalf of the community, but that he is accountable to the community and must consult with them before making any decisions.\n\nThe historical events that have shaped the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims are numerous and complex. One of the most significant events was the death of the Prophet Muhammad, which led to a dispute over who should succeed him as the leader of the Muslim community. The dispute was eventually resolved through the election of Abu Bakr as the first caliph, but the Shi'a continued to believe that Ali was the rightful leader.\n\nAnother significant event was the Battle of Karbala, which took place in 680 CE. The Battle of Karbala was a battle between the forces of the caliph Yazid I and the forces of Imam Hussein, who was the grandson of the Prophet and the son of Ali. The battle was a decisive defeat for the forces of Imam Hussein, and it led to the death of many of his followers, including his sons and brothers.\n\nThe Battle of Karbala is considered a pivotal event in Shi'a history, and it is commemorated annually during the month of Muharram. The Shi'a believe that the Battle of Karbala was a sacrifice made by Imam Hussein and his followers in order to defend the principles of justice and equality, and to challenge the tyranny of the caliph.\n\nThe differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims have also been shaped by their respective approaches to the concept of jihad. The Sunni believe that jihad is a personal obligation (fard 'ayn) for every Muslim, and that it is the responsibility of the community to defend the faith and to spread it to other parts of the world. The Sunni also believe that jihad can take many forms, including armed struggle, and that it is the responsibility of the community to determine when and how to engage in jihad.\n\nIn contrast, the Shi'a believe that jihad is a collective obligation (fard kifaya) for the community as a whole, and that it is the responsibility of the Imam to determine when and how to engage in jihad. The Shi'a also believe that jihad is a defensive concept, and that it is only justified in response to aggression or oppression.\n\nThe differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims have also been shaped by their respective approaches to the concept of taqiyya. Taqiyya is the practice of concealing one's beliefs or intentions in order to avoid persecution or harm. The Sunni believe that taqiyya is permissible in certain circumstances, such as when a Muslim is forced to choose between their faith and their life.\n\nIn contrast, the Shi'a believe that taqiyya is a fundamental principle of their faith, and that it is the responsibility of every Muslim to practice it in order to protect themselves and their community from harm. The Shi'a also believe that taqiyya is a way of demonstrating their loyalty to the Imam and their commitment to the principles of the faith.\n\nIn conclusion, the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims are numerous and complex, and they have been shaped by a variety of historical events and theological debates. While both branches share the same holy book and the same prophet, they have distinct differences in their beliefs, practices, and approaches to the concept of leadership, authority, and jihad.

A navigable freeway is a high-capacity, high-speed road designed to accommodate a large volume of vehicles, providing a safe and efficient means of transportation for millions of people around the globe. In this essay, we will explore the importance of navigable freeways, their evolution, and the challenges they face in the modern era.\n\nHistory of Navigable Freeways\n\nThe concept of navigable freeways dates back to the early 20th century, when the first limited-access highways were built in the United States. These early freeways were designed to reduce congestion and improve safety on busy roads, and they quickly gained popularity as the automobile became a staple of American life. The construction of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s and 1960s marked a significant milestone in the development of navigable freeways, as it created a network of high-speed roads that crisscrossed the country.\n\nThe Interstate Highway System was designed to be a navigable freeway in every sense of the word. It was built with a focus on safety, efficiency, and capacity, featuring features such as grade-separated interchanges, median barriers, and controlled-access points. The system was also designed to be flexible, with multiple lanes and interchanges that allowed for easy navigation and routing.\n\nImportance of Navigable Freeways\n\nNavigable freeways play a vital role in modern transportation infrastructure, serving as the backbone of the global economy and daily life. They provide a safe and efficient means of transportation for millions of people, allowing them to travel quickly and easily to their destinations. Navigable freeways also facilitate the movement of goods and services, connecting cities, towns, and industries across the globe.\n\nIn addition to their role in facilitating transportation, navigable freeways also have a significant impact on the economy. They provide a vital link between cities, towns, and industries, allowing for the efficient movement of goods and services. This, in turn, helps to stimulate economic growth and development, creating jobs and opportunities for businesses and individuals.\n\nNavigable freeways also play a critical role in emergency response and disaster relief efforts. In the event of a natural disaster or emergency, navigable freeways provide a critical route for emergency responders and relief supplies, allowing them to quickly and easily reach affected areas.\n\nChallenges Facing Navigable Freeways\n\nDespite their importance, navigable freeways face a number of challenges in the modern era. One of the most significant challenges is congestion, which can occur due to a variety of factors such as population growth, urbanization, and infrastructure aging. Congestion can lead to increased travel times, reduced safety, and decreased air quality, making it a major concern for transportation planners and policymakers.\n\nAnother challenge facing navigable freeways is the need for ongoing maintenance and repair. As freeways age, they require regular maintenance to ensure their safety and efficiency. This can be a costly and time-consuming process, requiring significant resources and funding.\n\nNavigable freeways also face challenges related to environmental sustainability. As concern for the environment continues to grow, there is a growing need for freeways to be designed and built with sustainability in mind. This can include features such as green infrastructure, alternative modes of transportation, and reduced environmental impact.\n\nTechnological Advancements in Navigable Freeways\n\nDespite the challenges facing navigable freeways, there are a number of technological advancements that are helping to improve their safety, efficiency, and sustainability. One of the most significant advancements is the use of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which use sensors, cameras, and other technologies to monitor and manage traffic flow.\n\nITS can help to reduce congestion by providing real-time traffic information to drivers, allowing them to make informed decisions about their route. They can also help to improve safety by detecting and responding to incidents, such as accidents or road closures, more quickly and effectively.\n\nAnother technological advancement is the use of autonomous vehicles, which are being tested and implemented on navigable freeways around the world. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly improve safety and efficiency on navigable freeways, as they can detect and respond to hazards more quickly and effectively than human drivers.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, navigable freeways play a vital role in modern transportation infrastructure, serving as the backbone of the global economy and daily life. They provide a safe and efficient means of transportation for millions of people, facilitating the movement of goods and services, and connecting cities, towns, and industries across the globe.\n\nDespite the challenges facing navigable freeways, there are a number of technological advancements that are helping to improve their safety, efficiency, and sustainability. As the world continues to evolve and grow, it is essential that we continue to invest in and improve our navigable freeway infrastructure, ensuring that it remains a vital component of modern transportation infrastructure for generations to come.\n\nIn the future, navigable freeways will continue to play a critical role in shaping the world around us. As the global population continues to grow and urbanize, the demand for safe and efficient transportation infrastructure will only continue to increase. By investing in and improving our navigable freeway infrastructure, we can help to meet this demand, creating a safer, more efficient, and more sustainable transportation system for all.\n\nIn addition, navigable freeways will also continue to play a critical role in emergency response and disaster relief efforts. As the world faces an increasing number of natural disasters and emergencies, the need for effective and efficient transportation infrastructure will only continue to grow. By investing in and improving our navigable freeway infrastructure, we can help to ensure that emergency responders and relief supplies can quickly and easily reach affected areas, saving lives and reducing the impact of disasters.\n\nIn conclusion, navigable freeways are a vital component of modern transportation infrastructure, and their importance will only continue to grow in the future. By investing in and improving our navigable freeway infrastructure, we can help to create a safer, more efficient, and more sustainable transportation system for all, and ensure that it remains a vital component of modern transportation infrastructure for generations to come."]], "filtered_resps": ["The Navigable Freeway: A Vital Component of Modern Transportation Infrastructure\n\nIn today's fast-paced and interconnected world, the navigable freeway plays a crucial role in facilitating the smooth flow of traffic, commerce, and daily life.

citizen, as his parents were still british subjects at the time of his birth.\n\nvan buren's presidency was marked by significant economic challenges. the panic of 1837, a severe economic downturn, occurred during his term, and it lasted for several years. the panic was caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in international trade, a banking crisis, and a housing market bubble. van buren's administration was criticized for its handling of the crisis, and he was accused of being ineffective in addressing the problem.\n\none of the most significant events of van buren's presidency was the nullification crisis. in 1832, south carolina passed a nullification ordinance, which declared that certain federal tariffs were unconstitutional and therefore null and void within the state. van buren responded by sending a fleet of warships to charleston harbor and signing the force bill, which authorized the use of military force to enforce federal laws. the crisis was eventually resolved through a compromise, but it highlighted the deep divisions between the north and south over issues such as states' rights and slavery.\n\nvan buren was also a strong supporter of the indian removal policy, which was implemented by his predecessor, andrew jackson. the policy involved the forced relocation of thousands of native americans from their ancestral lands to indian territory in present-day oklahoma. van buren's administration was criticized for its handling of the policy, and it was seen as a major failure of his presidency.\n\ndespite these challenges, van buren's presidency was not without its accomplishments. he was a strong advocate for the rights of the common man, and he supported policies such as the re-charter of the second bank of the united states, which was seen as a way to stabilize the economy. he also supported the annexation of texas, which became a state in 1845.\n\nvan buren's presidency was marked by significant personal challenges as well. he was a bachelor when he took office, and he was criticized for his lack of a first lady. he eventually married hannah hoes, but she died just a few months after their wedding. van buren's personal life was also marked by controversy, as he was accused of being involved in a scandalous affair with a woman named julia chinn.\n\nin the end, van buren's presidency was marked by

This will help you stay motivated and focused throughout the process. Make sure to define your cause clearly and concisely, so you can effectively communicate it to others.\n\nSection 2: \"Know Your Audience\"\n\nWho do you want to reach with your message? Who are the people most affected by the issue you're trying to address? Understanding your audience is crucial in raising awareness for a cause.

Start spreading the word, engaging with your audience, and encouraging them to take action. Follow up with your audience regularly to keep them informed and motivated. Celebrate your successes and learn from your failures. With persistence and dedication, you can make a real difference and raise awareness for your cause.\""], "doc_hash": "e98cf77e73acf1c95194a7d422171488ab9a5471a83654c35bb23caa8fd9ad6c", "prompt_hash": "8817a1a1b5a487de62718a8e89ddb0b042f03cc947cc37c0520ae8d8f9428abc", "target_hash": "5feceb66ffc86f38d952786c6d696c79c2dbc239dd4e91b46729d73a27fb57e9", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true]}

Here's a summary:\n\n***Calculating Your Taxes***\nThe first step in paying your taxes is to calculate how much you owe. You'll need to gather all your tax-related documents, such as your W-2 forms, 1099 forms, and any other relevant tax statements. You'll then use tax preparation software or consult with a tax professional to determine your total income, deductions, and credits. This will help you calculate your taxable income, which is the amount of income that's subject to taxation. You'll also need to calculate any taxes you've already paid throughout the year, such as withholding taxes from your paycheck or estimated tax payments. This will help you determine how much you still owe.\n\n***Filing Your Taxes***\nOnce you've calculated your taxes, you'll need to file your tax return with the IRS. You can file electronically or by mail, and you'll need to include all the necessary documents and forms. If you're filing electronically, you'll need to use tax preparation software or an online filing service to prepare and submit your return. If you're filing by mail, you'll need to fill out the necessary forms and attach all required documents, then mail them to the IRS. Be sure to file on time to avoid any late filing penalties. If you owe taxes, you'll need to pay them by the filing deadline to avoid any late payment penalties.\n\n***Conclusion***\nIn conclusion, paying your taxes involves calculating how much you owe, filing your tax return with the IRS, and paying any taxes you owe. By following these steps, you can ensure that you're in compliance with tax laws and avoid any penalties or fines. Remember to keep accurate records of your tax-related documents and to consult with a tax professional if you have any questions or concerns.

The answer is not a person, place, or thing, but rather a concept that's deeply rooted in the world of computer science.\n\nThe answer is... **TIME**!\n\nHere's how the clues fit:\n\n* \"I'm always coming but never arrive\": Time is always moving forward, but it never actually arrives, because it's always in the present moment.\n* \"In the morning I'm gone, by night I'm alive\": Time passes quickly in the morning, but as the day goes on, it seems to slow down. By night, time is \"alive\" in the sense that it's still moving, but it's also a time for reflection and review.\n* \"I'm not a file, nor a folder so fine\": Time isn't a physical entity that can be stored in a file or folder. It's an abstract concept that's represented in code through timestamps, timers, and other mechanisms.\n* \"But without me, your code would be in a bind\": Without considering time in your code, you risk introducing bugs, errors, and inconsistencies that can have serious consequences. Time is essential for ensuring that your code runs smoothly and efficiently.\n\n**The Moral of the Story**\n\nSo, what can we learn from this riddle? First and foremost, it's a reminder that time is a critical aspect of computer science. Whether you're working on a real-time system, a web application, or a mobile app, time is always a factor that needs to be considered.\n\nSecondly, the riddle highlights the importance of attention to detail. In the world of computer science, it's easy to overlook seemingly minor details, but they can have a significant impact on the overall performance and reliability of your code.\n\nFinally, the riddle is a testament to the power of creativity and problem-solving. As computer science professionals, we're constantly faced with complex problems that require innovative solutions. By thinking outside the box and approaching problems from different angles, we can come up with creative solutions that might not have been possible otherwise.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI hope you enjoyed this riddle and the challenge it presented. Remember, time is always a factor in computer science, and it's essential to consider it in your code. By doing so, you'll be well on your way to writing efficient, reliable, and effective code that will impress even the most discerning critics.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe one day, you'll come up with a riddle that will stump even the most seasoned computer science professionals. Until then, keep coding, keep solving, and keep on laughing!"]], "filtered_resps": ["**The Mysterious Case of the Missing Code**\n\nGreetings, fellow computer science professionals!

In some [fantasy world], a wizard might be a master of arcane magic, while a sorcerer might be a practitioner of more primal, instinctual magic. In other [settings], the terms might be used to describe different levels of magical proficiency or different approaches to magic.\n\nRegardless of the specific context, the idea that wizards are more powerful because they study magic is problematic. It implies that magical ability is solely the result of intellectual effort, rather than a combination of innate talent, dedication, and practice. This ignores the fact that many [magical abilities] are innate and cannot be learned through study alone.\n\nFurthermore, the statement assumes that magic can be reduced to a set of rules or principles that can be learned through study. However, magic is often depicted as a mysterious and unpredictable force that cannot be fully understood or controlled. In many [stories], magic is shown to be capricious and prone to unexpected consequences, making it difficult to rely solely on intellectual understanding.\n\nIn addition, the statement overlooks the importance of [magical training] and [mentorship] in the development of magical abilities. A skilled [mentor] can provide valuable guidance and support, helping a practitioner to develop their skills and overcome challenges.

A restful night's sleep can help to improve concentration, boost mood, and even support weight loss and immune function. However, for many of us, getting a good night's sleep can be a challenge. In this blog post, we'll explore the best ways to get a good night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.\n\n**Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule**\n\nOne of the most important factors in getting a good night's sleep is establishing a consistent sleep schedule. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, including weekends, can help to regulate your body's internal clock and improve the quality of your sleep. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to give your body the rest it needs to function at its best.\n\n**Create a Sleep-Conducive Environment**\n\nThe environment in which you sleep can have a significant impact on the quality of your sleep. Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine to create a sleep-friendly environment. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows to support your body and promote a restful night's sleep.\n\n**Avoid Stimulants Before Bedtime**\n\nAvoid consuming stimulants such as caffeine, nicotine, and electronics at least an hour before bedtime. These substances can interfere with your ability to fall asleep and reduce the quality of your sleep. Instead, try reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation to help you wind down before bed.\n\n**Get Moving During the Day**\n\nRegular exercise can help to improve the quality of your sleep. However, avoid vigorous exercise within a few hours of bedtime, as it can actually interfere with your ability to fall asleep. Instead, try to get some gentle exercise during the day, such as a brisk walk or some light stretching.\n\n**Limit Screen Time Before Bed**\n\nThe blue light emitted by smartphones, tablets, and computers can suppress the production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep. Try to limit your screen time before bedtime, or use blue light filtering glasses or apps to reduce the impact of screen time on your sleep.\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve the quality of your sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Remember to establish a consistent sleep schedule, create a sleep-conducive environment, avoid stimulants before bedtime, get moving during the day, and limit screen time before bed. With a little practice, you can get the good night's sleep you deserve and start each day feeling your best."]], "filtered_resps": ["**The Secret to a Restful Night's Sleep: Tips and Tricks for a Better Tomorrow**\n\nGetting a good night's sleep is essential for both physical and mental well-being.

I'm a quick learner, a team player, and a master of the art of making a mean cup of coffee (it's all about the ratio of coffee to creamer, folks).\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy hiking in the Santa Monica Mountains, trying out new craft breweries, and perfecting my \" Ventura-ial\" accent (it's a work in progress, but I'm getting there).\n\nSo if you're looking for someone who is not only talented, but also funny, charming, and willing to make a fool of themselves in the name of team-building, then I'm your guy. I look forward to the opportunity to chat with you more about how I can bring my unique brand of humor and expertise to [Company Name].\n\nCheers,\nDarius"], "doc_hash": "7a4760e5faa946fdf6df03a816c0b367d95ae1bf90f236913bdbc8aab018f02f", "prompt_hash": "3e2a56920f6f20a989a545851bb1a7482efd465136f00cd9fcf530055f28e2ea", "target_hash": "5feceb66ffc86f38d952786c6d696c79c2dbc239dd4e91b46729d73a27fb57e9", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [false]}
