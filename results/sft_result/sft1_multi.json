The plot twists were predictable, the characters were one-dimensional, and don't even get me started on the atrocious acting. It's like they took all the creativity and originality and flushed it down the toilet. I've seen better storytelling in a YouTube video. The sequel better redeem this franchise or I'm done with this series for good. Disappointing doesn't even scratch the surface of how infuriating this was. Save your time and watch something worth your anger.",
