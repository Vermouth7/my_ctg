Then we want to find the largest number of elements in $S$ that are not in $A_3$.

We want to find the odds that a randomly selected candidate knows Excel and is willing to work nights. This means we need to find the intersection of the two groups: candidates who know Excel and candidates who are willing to work nights.\n\nSince 20% of the candidates know Excel, and 30% of the candidates are willing to work nights (100% - 70% = 30%), the intersection of these two groups is 20% x 30% = 6%. This means that 6 out of 100 candidates know Excel and are willing to work nights.\n\nThe final answer is 6%.",

To find her total score, we multiply the number of quizzes by the average score: 4 x 92 = 368. Since the final quiz is worth the same as each previous quiz, her total score will be the same after the final quiz. To get an A in the class, she needs to average 93% over the 5 quizzes. To find her total score needed, we multiply the number of quizzes by the average score: 5 x 93 = 465. Since she already has a total score of 368, she needs an additional score of 465 - 368 = 97.

The shirts normally cost $15 each, but with 20% off, the price is 15 - (15 x 0.20) = 15 - 3 = 12 dollars each. So the total cost of the shirts is 20 x 12 = 240 dollars.\n\nThe order qualified for free shipping, so Tom doesn't need to pay for shipping. However, he still needs to pay 10% tax on the total cost of the shirts. 10% of 240 is 0.10 x 240 = 24 dollars. So Tom needs to pay 240 + 24 = 264 dollars.\n\nThe final answer is 264.",

You must not output any other text.\nText to be judged: Let's start by using the information that two siblings are 66 inches tall. This means that 2 x 66 = 132 inches are accounted for.\n\nAnother sibling is 60 inches tall, so we add that to the total: 132 + 60 = 192 inches.\n\nThe total height of all 5 siblings is 330 inches, so we subtract the 192 inches we've already accounted for from the total: 330 - 192 = 138 inches.\n\nThis means that the last two siblings combined are 138 inches tall. Since Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sibling, we can set up an equation:\n\nLast sibling's height = Eliza's height + 2\n\nLet's call the last sibling's height \"x\". Then we can write:\n\nx = Eliza's height + 2\n\nWe know that the last two siblings combined are 138 inches tall, so we can set up another equation:\n\nx + Eliza's height = 138\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get:\n\n(Eliza's height + 2) + Eliza's height = 138\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2 x Eliza's height + 2 = 138\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n2 x Eliza's height = 136\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nEliza's height = 68\n\nSo Eliza is 68 inches tall.

Let's call his initial amount x. Then, he spent x/2.\n2. He then spent $14 more, so his total amount spent so far is x/2 + 14.\n3. He then went to another store and spent one-third of his starting money, which is x/3. He also spent $16 more.\n4. Since he had no money left, the total amount he spent is equal to his initial amount. So, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 14 + x/3 + 16 = x\n5. Simplify the equation: x/2 + x/3 = x - 30\n6. Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate fractions: 3x + 2x = 6x - 180\n7. Combine like terms: 5x = 6x - 180\n8. Subtract 6x from both sides: -x = -180\n9.

So, we can set up an equation:\n\nLength = 4 x Width\n\nSubstituting the value of length (36 inches) into this equation, we get:\n\n36 = 4 x Width\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nWidth = 36 / 4\nWidth = 9 inches\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the volume of the box.

The distance traveled was 275 km. To find the fuel consumption per 100 km, we need to divide the amount of gasoline used (33 liters) by the distance traveled (275 km), and then multiply by 100.\n\nFirst, divide 33 liters by 275 km: 33 ÷ 275 = 0.12 liters/km\n\nThen, multiply by 100: 0.12 liters/km × 100 = 12 liters/100 km\n\nThe final answer is 12 liters/100 km.",

Since she earned $8,000 total, we can set up the equation:\n\n$3,000 (base salary) + 0.02x (commission) = $8,000\n\nwhere x is the total value of the houses she sold.\n\nSubtracting $3,000 from both sides, we get:\n\n0.02x = $5,000\n\nDividing both sides by 0.02, we get:\n\nx = $250,000\n\nSo the total value of the houses she sold is $250,000.\n\nNow, let's use the information about the prices of the houses. House B costs three times as much as House A, so if House A costs x, then House B costs 3x.\n\nHouse C costs twice as much as House A minus $110,000, so if House A costs x, then House C costs 2x - $110,000.\n\nWe know that the total value of the houses is $250,000, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 3x + (2x - $110,000) = $250,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n6x - $110,000 = $250,000\n\nAdd $110,000 to both sides:\n\n6x = $360,000\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nx = $60,000\n\nSo House A costs $60,000.\n\nThe final answer is $60,000.",

Since there are 6 ounces of Coke, the ratio of Coke to the total drink is 6:?. We know that the ratio of Coke to the total drink is 2:?, so we can set up the equation:\n\n6/x = 2/?\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n6 * ? = 2 * x\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n3? = x\n\nSo the total drink is 3 times the amount of Coke, which is 6 ounces. 3 * 6 = 18. The final answer is 18.",
