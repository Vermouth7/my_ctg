Let's call the number of jumps Hattie did in the second round \"x\". Then, Lorelei did x + 50 jumps in the second round.\n4. Hattie managed to jump 2/3 times the number of jumps she did in the first round, so she did 180 x 2/3 = 120 jumps in the second round.\n5.

Since each centerpiece will have the same number of lilies, let's call the number of lilies per centerpiece \"x\". Then, the total number of lilies is 6x.\n\nThe total cost of the lilies is:\n\n6x lilies x $15 per lily = $90x\n\nSince Martha wants to spend a total of $2700, we can set up the equation:\n\n$2160 + $90x = $2700\n\nSubtracting $2160 from both sides gives:\n\n$90x = $540\n\nDividing both sides by $90 gives:\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, Martha will put 6 lilies in each centerpiece.

Since there are 50 marbles in total, half of 50 is 25, so there are 25 white marbles.\n\nWe are also told that there are 12 yellow marbles. Since there are 50% fewer green marbles than yellow marbles, the number of green marbles is 12 - (12 x 0.5) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n\nNow we know that there are 25 white marbles, 12 yellow marbles, and 6 green marbles. To find the number of red marbles, we subtract the number of white, yellow, and green marbles from the total number of marbles:\n\n50 - 25 - 12 - 6 = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 red marbles.

Since Kelly weighs 34 kilograms, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.85M = 34\n\nTo solve for M, we can divide both sides by 0.85:\n\nM = 34 / 0.85\nM = 40\n\nSo Megan weighs 40 kilograms. Mike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan, so Mike weighs:\n\n40 + 5 = 45\n\nNow we can find the total weight of the three children:\n\nKelly: 34 kilograms\nMegan: 40 kilograms\nMike: 45 kilograms\n\nTotal weight: 34 + 40 + 45 = 119 kilograms\n\nThe bridge can hold up to 100 kilograms, so the three children weigh 119 - 100 = 19 kilograms too much.

To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.20: x = 400 / 0.20 = 2000.\n3. This means Ben's after-tax income is $2000.\n4. He pays 1/3 of his gross income in taxes. Let's call his gross income \"y\". Then, 1/3y = taxes.\n5. Since Ben's after-tax income is $2000, his after-tax income is equal to his gross income minus taxes: y - 1/3y = 2000.\n6. Simplify the equation: 2/3y = 2000.\n7. Multiply both sides by 3/2: y = 3000.\n\nSo, Ben makes $3000 per month before taxes. The final answer is 3000.",

The number of female hippos is 5/7 of the total number of hippos, so the number of female hippos is 35 x 5/7 = 25.\n3. Each female hippo gives birth to 5 new baby hippos, so the total number of new baby hippos is 25 x 5 = 125.\n4.

Rearranging, we have that $ab+bc=0$. Substituting $c=3-a-b$ into the third equation, we have that $abc=3$, which simplifies to $a(3-a-b)b=3$.

Since 1 knot is equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and 1 nautical mile is equal to 1.15 land miles, we can convert the speeds to land miles per hour:\n\nWith one sail: 25 knots * 1.15 land miles/nautical mile = 28.75 land miles per hour\nWith two sails: 50 knots * 1.15 land miles/nautical mile = 57.5 land miles per hour\n\nBuffy travels for 4 hours with one sail, so the distance traveled is:\n\n28.75 land miles per hour * 4 hours = 115 land miles\n\nThen, she travels for another 4 hours with two sails, so the distance traveled is:\n\n57.5 land miles per hour * 4 hours = 230 land miles\n\nThe total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances:\n\n115 land miles + 230 land miles = 345 land miles\n\nThe final answer is 345.",

Since there are now 2 tests, the total score is the sum of the scores of both tests.\n3. Let's call the score on the second test \"x\". Then, the total score is 78 + x.\n4. Since the average is 81, the total score divided by 2 is 81. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n(78 + x) / 2 = 81\n\n5. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:\n\n78 + x = 162\n\n6.

Then, Rockefeller has 2x + 3000 guns.\n2. Rockefeller has 400 less than thrice as many war tractors as Grenada Army Base. Since Grenada has x guns, they have 3x war tractors. Rockefeller has 3x - 400 war tractors.\n3. Rockefeller has 30 times as many soldier uniforms as Grenada Army Base reserved for its national protection. Since Grenada has x guns, they have x war supplies in total. So, Rockefeller has 30x soldier uniforms.\n4. Grenada's war supplies are equally divided among the 6000 war supplies they have in total. This means that x = 6000/3 = 2000 (since there are 3 types of war supplies: guns, war tractors, and soldier uniforms).\n5. Now we can calculate the total war supplies Rockefeller has:\n\t* Guns: 2x + 3000 = 2(2000) + 3000 = 4000 + 3000 = 7000\n\t* War tractors: 3x - 400 = 3(2000) - 400 = 6000 - 400 = 5600\n\t* Soldier uniforms: 30x = 30(2000) = 60000\n6.

To find out how many bags she sold, we need to subtract the number of bags she has now from the number of bags she had initially, and then subtract the number of bags she restocked.\n\n55 (initial bags) - 164 (current bags) = -109 (she sold 109 bags)\n-109 - 132 (bags restocked) = -241 (this is not possible, as she can't sell a negative number of bags)\n\nLet's try again. Let's say she sold x bags. Then, the number of bags she has now is the number of bags she had initially minus the number of bags she sold, plus the number of bags she restocked.\n\n55 - x + 132 = 164\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n187 - x = 164\n\nSubtracting 164 from both sides, we get:\n\nx = 23\n\nSo, the trader sold 23 bags of rice.

This means that 2 x 66 = 132 inches are accounted for.\n\nAnother sibling is 60 inches tall, so we add that to the total: 132 + 60 = 192 inches.\n\nThe total height of all 5 siblings is 330 inches, so we subtract the 192 inches we've already accounted for from the total: 330 - 192 = 138 inches.\n\nThis means that the last two siblings combined are 138 inches tall. Since Eliza is 2 inches shorter than the last sibling, we can set up an equation:\n\nLast sibling's height = Eliza's height + 2\n\nLet's call the last sibling's height \"x\". Then we can write:\n\nx = Eliza's height + 2\n\nWe know that the last two siblings combined are 138 inches tall, so we can set up another equation:\n\nx + Eliza's height = 138\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get:\n\n(Eliza's height + 2) + Eliza's height = 138\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2 x Eliza's height + 2 = 138\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n2 x Eliza's height = 136\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nEliza's height = 68\n\nSo Eliza is 68 inches tall.

We don't know the exact number, but we can add them together: x + 2x = 3x.\n* Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Let's say Mum gave y toy cars. Then dad gave 10 = y - 5. We can solve for y: y = 15. So mum gave 15 toy cars, and dad gave 10.\n* Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. We already know the uncle gave x toy cars, so auntie gave x + 1 = 6. We can solve for x: x = 5. So the uncle gave 5 toy cars, and auntie gave 6.\n* Now, let's add up all the gifts: 3x (from grandpa and uncle) + 10 (from dad) + 15 (from mum) + 6 (from auntie) = 3(5) + 10 + 15 + 6 = 15 + 10 + 15 + 6 = 46.\n\nOlaf started with 150 toy cars and received 46 more.

Therefore, the point $X$ is $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional if and only if $X$ is not on the $20$-degree counterclockwise rotation of the $60$ rays.
